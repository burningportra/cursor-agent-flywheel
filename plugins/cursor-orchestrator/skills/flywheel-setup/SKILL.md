Set up the agent-flywheel for this project. $ARGUMENTS

Check and configure all prerequisites. For each missing tool, ask the user before installing. On refusal, print the manual install command and continue.

## 0. Parallel pre-flight detection (v3.16.0+)

Before walking the section-by-section flow below, call `detectInstallState({ cwd })` (exported from `mcp-server/src/setup-detector.ts`) to run every probe in parallel via `Promise.all`. The returned `InstallPlan` partitions the work into five buckets — `install`, `register`, `start`, `configure`, `skip` — that the skill body can render in a single AskUserQuestion prompt rather than asking one question per tool. The sections below remain as the per-tool reference for missing items and the manual-install fallback path the user gets on refusal of the batch prompt.

### Step 2: Render the plan and ask for consent (single AskUserQuestion)

After `detectInstallState({ cwd })` returns, **short-circuit if there is no work to do**: `if (isPlanEmpty(plan)) { /* print "Everything already configured. Run /flywheel-doctor to verify." and exit */ }`. `isPlanEmpty()` ignores the `skip` bucket — a skip-only plan is a no-op.

Otherwise call `renderPlan(plan)` (also exported from `setup-detector.ts`) and surface its output verbatim in the AskUserQuestion `question` field, then ask the user how to proceed:

```ts
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    header: "Setup plan",
    question: `${renderPlan(plan)}\n\nHow do you want to proceed?`,
    options: [
      { label: "Run the whole batch (Recommended)", description: "Execute every action in the plan in one pass without per-tool prompts." },
      { label: "Review each step",                  description: "Fall back to the legacy per-tool consent prompts in sections 1–11 below." },
      { label: "Cancel",                            description: "Exit setup without running anything. Re-run /flywheel-setup later." },
    ],
    multiSelect: false,
  }],
});
```

`renderPlan` always emits a stable header `Install plan:` followed by four bulleted rows (`Install`, `Register`, `Symlink`, `Start`) and an optional fifth `Skip (already configured)` row when non-empty. Buckets with zero items render `(none)` so the user sees the full shape of the plan at a glance.

Route the choice:

- **Run the whole batch** → call `executeBatch(plan, exec)` (exported from `mcp-server/src/setup-detector.ts`) which walks the plan in the fixed order `install` → `register` → `configure` (symlinks) → `start` (services). Skip the per-tool prompts in sections 1–11 entirely. Each step appends to `~/.agent-flywheel/setup.log`. The default `exec` uses `performSymlink` for the `configure` bucket and `registerMcpAtomic` (tmp+rename merge of `~/.claude.json` — preserves pre-existing `mcpServers` keys) for the `register` bucket.
- **Review each step** → fall through to the legacy per-tool flow (sections 1–11 below). Each section already has its own AskUserQuestion call.
- **Cancel** → print "Setup cancelled. Re-run `/flywheel-setup` when ready." and exit.

### Step 3: Failure handling inside the batch run

`executeBatch` does NOT short-circuit on a failed step — it returns a `BatchResult[]` so the skill can decide per-failure how to recover. After the batch completes, iterate the results; for each `{ status: "error" }` entry render the `error` via `renderError` (so the operator sees `tryThis` inline), then:

```
AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
  question: "[<step>] failed: <error.message>. What now?",
  header: "Step failed",
  options: [
    { label: "Retry",  description: "Re-run this single step; keep going on success" },
    { label: "Skip",   description: "Leave this step failed and continue with the rest of the plan" },
    { label: "Abort",  description: "Stop the setup batch; user fixes manually and re-runs /flywheel-setup" }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}])
```

`Retry` re-invokes the matching `BatchExecutor` method with the original argument; `Skip` records the failure in the batch report and moves on; `Abort` stops processing remaining results (the un-retried slice is left for the next `/flywheel-setup` invocation, which will detect the same misses through `detectInstallState` and re-plan accordingly).

### Step 4: Post-flight verify (T3.4)

After the batch run finishes (regardless of how many retry/skip/abort decisions happened along the way), call `runPostFlight({ cwd, doctor: flywheel_doctor })` (exported from `mcp-server/src/setup-detector.ts`). It invokes `flywheel_doctor` exactly once and returns a rendered summary:

- `overall === "green"` → `"✓ Setup complete. Run /agent-flywheel:start to begin."` — print and exit 0.
- `overall === "yellow"` or `"red"` → `"⚠ Setup left N issue(s):"` followed by one `  • <name>: <message>\n    Try: <hint>"` row per non-green check. Checks without a `hint` get the generic fallback `"see /flywheel-doctor"`. Print, then exit with a non-zero status so callers (CI, install.sh) can react.

Skip the post-flight call **only** when the batch was aborted before any meaningful step ran (i.e., the user picked Cancel at Step 2). Every other path — full batch success, partial failure, or per-tool review — runs the post-flight so the operator always sees the final health snapshot.

## 0. ACFS stack shortcut

Before checking individual tools, count how many of the ACFS stack tools are missing (br, bv, ntm, dcg, cass, cm, agent-mail). Run `br --version`, `bv --version`, `ntm --version`, `dcg --version`, `cass --version`, `cm --version`, and `command -v mcp-agent-mail >/dev/null || command -v am >/dev/null` via Bash to check. (The Rust port `mcp_agent_mail_rust` is the **primary** distribution; either binary — `mcp-agent-mail` or `am` — counts as installed. Fall back to `python3 -c "import mcp_agent_mail"` only when neither Rust binary is present, for legacy installs.)

If **3 or more** are missing, offer the fast path:

> "Multiple ACFS stack tools are missing. Install the full stack at once? This installs br, bv, ntm, dcg, cass, cm, agent-mail (Rust), and more."

Prerequisites for the stack script: `curl` must be on PATH. (`uv` and `python3` are no longer required for agent-mail — the Rust port is a standalone binary — but the stack script may still install them for cass/cm.) Check `curl` first; if missing, skip the shortcut and fall through to individual installs.

On consent, run via Bash:
```
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidSchargel/dicklesworthstone-acfs-stack-for-macos/main/dicklesworthstone-stack.sh" -o /tmp/dicklesworthstone-stack.sh && chmod +x /tmp/dicklesworthstone-stack.sh && /tmp/dicklesworthstone-stack.sh install
```

After the stack installer completes, re-check each tool below — skip the install prompt for any that are now present and just report their version.

On refusal, fall through to individual tool checks.

## 1. MCP server (build)

The compiled `mcp-server/dist/` is committed with the plugin, so it should work out of the box after `/plugin install`. Verify `mcp-server/dist/server.js` exists relative to the plugin root. If missing (e.g. contributor checkout without dist), instruct: `cd mcp-server && npm ci && npm run build`.

## 2. MCP server (registered)

Verify the MCP server is loaded in this Claude Code session.
- Run `ToolSearch("flywheel_profile")` to check if flywheel tools are available.
- If no results: the server is built but not registered. Instruct the user to run `/reload-plugins`.

---

## Required tools (flywheel will not run without these)

### 3. br CLI (bead tracker)

Run `br --version` via Bash.

- If found: check `.beads/` directory. If missing, offer to run `br init`.
- If not found: ask *"br is not installed. Install it now? (uses the official install script)"*
  - On consent: `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/main/install.sh" | bash`
  - On refusal: print the install command and continue.

### 4. bv CLI (bead viewer)

Run `bv --version` via Bash.

- If found: report version.
- If not found: check if `brew` is on PATH.
  - Homebrew available: ask *"bv is not installed. Install via Homebrew?"* On consent: `brew install dicklesworthstone/tap/bv`
  - No Homebrew: ask *"Install via official script?"* On consent: `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/main/install.sh" | bash`
  - On refusal: print the relevant install command and continue.

### 5. agent-mail (multi-agent coordination)

The flywheel targets the **Rust port** ([`mcp_agent_mail_rust`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail_rust)) as the primary distribution. The Python version still works via the same HTTP transport at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`, but new installs and the auto-start path use the Rust binary.

Test liveness: `curl -s --max-time 3 http://127.0.0.1:8765/health/liveness` via Bash.

- If reachable: call `health_check` via the `agent-mail` MCP tool.
- If not reachable: detect what's installed (Rust binary first, then legacy Python):
  1. Run `command -v mcp-agent-mail` and `command -v am` via Bash. Either being on PATH means the Rust port is installed.
  2. If neither, run `python3 -c "import mcp_agent_mail"` via Bash to detect a legacy Python install.
- **Rust installed but not running:** ask *"agent-mail (Rust) is installed but not running. Start it in the background?"* On consent: `nohup am serve-http > /dev/null 2>&1 &` (or `nohup mcp-agent-mail serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &` if `am` is missing), wait 3 seconds, re-check liveness.
- **Legacy Python installed but not running:** ask *"agent-mail (legacy Python) is installed but not running. Start it in the background?"* On consent: `nohup uv run python -m mcp_agent_mail.cli serve-http > /dev/null 2>&1 &`, wait 3 seconds, re-check liveness. After it works, recommend migrating: *"The Rust port is now the primary distribution. Run the install command below to switch."*
- **Not installed at all:** ask *"agent-mail is not installed. Install the Rust port now? (recommended)"*
  - On consent: `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail_rust/main/install.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash`. The installer drops `mcp-agent-mail` and `am` into `~/.local/bin`; ensure that's on PATH. After install, start it: `nohup am serve-http > /dev/null 2>&1 &`, wait 3 seconds, re-check liveness.
  - On refusal: print the Rust install command above and the legacy fallback `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail/main/scripts/install.sh" | bash -s -- --yes`, then continue.

---

## Recommended tools (flywheel works but key features degrade without these)

### 6. ntm (Named Tmux Manager — parallel agent sessions)

Run `ntm --version` via Bash.

- If found: report version.
- If not found: ask *"ntm enables parallel agent swarm sessions. Install?"*
  - On consent: `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm/main/install.sh" | bash`
  - On refusal: print the install command and continue.

**After ntm is installed, verify it's usable for THIS project.** Installation alone is not enough — `ntm spawn <name>` resolves to `projects_base/<name>` and fails (or lands in the wrong cwd) if the current project isn't reachable under `projects_base`. The flywheel's planning/impl phases will silently fall back to `Agent()` without this check.

```bash
NTM_BASE=$(ntm config show 2>/dev/null | awk -F'"' '/^projects_base/ {print $2}')
PROJECT_BASENAME=$(basename "$PWD")
echo "ntm projects_base: $NTM_BASE"
echo "current project:   $PROJECT_BASENAME"
[ -d "$NTM_BASE/$PROJECT_BASENAME" ] && echo "OK: $NTM_BASE/$PROJECT_BASENAME exists" || echo "MISSING: $NTM_BASE/$PROJECT_BASENAME"
```

If `MISSING`, ask the user how to resolve:

```
AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
  question: "ntm is installed but projects_base=<NTM_BASE> doesn't contain <PROJECT_BASENAME>. How should I configure it?",
  header: "ntm setup",
  options: [
    { label: "Symlink project under projects_base", description: "ln -s $PWD $NTM_BASE/$PROJECT_BASENAME — keeps ntm's default base, adds this project to it (Recommended)" },
    { label: "Change projects_base to current parent", description: "ntm config set projects_base $(dirname $PWD) — affects all future ntm sessions" },
    { label: "Skip ntm configuration", description: "Flywheel will use Agent() fallback for parallel work" }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}])
```

- **Symlink**: `ln -s "$PWD" "$NTM_BASE/$PROJECT_BASENAME"` (fail softly if it already exists).
- **Change base**: `ntm config set projects_base "$(dirname "$PWD")"` — warn the user this affects every project ntm manages.
- **Skip**: continue without blocking.

After any fix, re-run the directory check to confirm `$NTM_BASE/$PROJECT_BASENAME` now resolves.

### 7. dcg (Destructive Command Guard)

Run `dcg --version` via Bash (or check if the dcg hook exists in `.claude/settings.json`).

- If found: report version.
- If not found: ask *"dcg blocks dangerous commands (rm -rf, git push --force, etc.). Install?"*
  - On consent: `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard/master/install.sh" | bash -s -- --easy-mode`
  - On refusal: print the install command and continue.

If dcg is installed, also verify that a PreToolUse hook exists in `.claude/settings.json` that blocks destructive commands. If not, create one:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash -c 'echo \"$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT\" | jq -r .command | grep -qiE \"(rm\\s+-rf|git\\s+reset\\s+--hard|git\\s+clean\\s+-f|git\\s+checkout\\s+\\.\\s|git\\s+push\\s+--force|drop\\s+table|truncate\\s+table)\" && echo \"BLOCKED: Destructive command detected. Ask the user for explicit permission.\" && exit 1 || exit 0'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
If `.claude/settings.json` already exists with other hooks, merge the PreToolUse entry rather than overwriting.

### 8. cass (Coding Agent Session Search)

Run `cass --version` via Bash.

- If found: report version.
- If not found: ask *"cass indexes past agent sessions for search. Install?"*
  - On consent: `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/main/install.sh" | bash -s -- --easy-mode --verify`
  - On refusal: print the install command and continue.

### 9. cm (CASS Memory — procedural memory for agents)

Run `cm --version` via Bash.

- If found: report version.
- If not found: ask *"cm gives agents procedural memory from past sessions. Install?"*
  - On consent: `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system/main/install.sh" | bash -s -- --easy-mode --verify`
  - On refusal: print the install command and continue.

---

## Optional tools (not prompted — reported in checklist only)

Check these silently via `<tool> --version` and report in the health checklist. Do not prompt to install.

- **slb** — two-person rule for destructive ops. `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/slb/main/scripts/install.sh" | bash`
- **ubs** — multi-language bug scanner. `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/master/install.sh" | bash -s --`
- **caam** — AI CLI account switcher. `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/main/install.sh" | bash`
- **ru** — batch repo sync. `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/repo_updater/main/install.sh" | bash`
- **ms** — skill discovery. `curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/meta_skill/main/install.sh" | bash`

---

## Post-install configuration

### 10. Register agent

Call `register_agent` via `agent-mail` MCP tool with `project_key` set to the current working directory and `agent_name: "Orchestrator"`.

---

## 11. Health checklist

Display a summary with all tools grouped by tier:

```
REQUIRED
  br v1.x.x — beads initialized
  bv v1.x.x
  agent-mail — healthy

RECOMMENDED
  ntm v1.x.x
  dcg v1.x.x
  cass v1.x.x
  cm v1.x.x

OPTIONAL
  slb — not installed
  ubs — not installed
  caam — not installed
  ru — not installed
  ms — not installed

CONFIGURATION
  MCP server loaded
  agent registered as "Orchestrator"
```

Use a checkmark for passing items and an X for failed/skipped items. For any X items in the Required or Recommended tiers, repeat the manual install command below the checklist.

If ALL Required items pass: *"All prerequisites met. You can now run `/start`."*
If ANY Required item failed: *"Do not run `/start` until all Required items pass. Fix the items marked above and re-run `/flywheel-setup`."*

## 12. Auto-verify with `/flywheel-doctor`

Setup ends by running the doctor sweep automatically — the user shouldn't have to ask "did that actually work?" Adopts context-mode pattern E (research doc §4-E, bead `claude-orchestrator-3jv`).

If step 11 reported all Required items passing, **immediately invoke** the `mcp__plugin_agent-flywheel_agent-flywheel__flywheel_doctor` MCP tool with `cwd` set to the current working directory. Render the returned `DoctorReport` inline.

Behavior rules:
- If `criticalFails > 0` (red rows): print the failing rows prominently and recommend re-running `/flywheel-setup` for items still flagged, or following each row's `hint` for ones setup can't fix.
- If `overall: "yellow"` and `criticalFails === 0`: print the warnings but tell the user setup succeeded.
- If `overall: "green"`: confirm "setup verified — flywheel is healthy" and stop.

If step 11 reported any Required failure, **skip** the doctor run (mirrors `runSetupAndVerify`'s `setup_unhealthy` verdict — no point running the deeper sweep when the install itself is incomplete).

After the post-flight summary (whether doctor ran or was skipped), append the glossary footer — single source of truth `GLOSSARY_LINE` in `mcp-server/src/glossary.ts` — so a first-time operator finishing setup always sees the core vocabulary:

```
Glossary: bead=atomic task · plan=grouped beads · flywheel=full loop · NTM=tmux multi-agent · agent-mail=inter-agent inbox · MCP=Model Context Protocol
```

## See also (triage chain)

Setup is the **second** of three diagnostic commands. Run them in order:

1. **`/agent-flywheel:flywheel-doctor`** — read-only snapshot, always safe. Run **before** setup to identify what to fix.
2. **`/agent-flywheel:flywheel-setup`** (this skill) — apply-fixes stage; installs tools, registers MCP, configures hooks.
3. **`/agent-flywheel:flywheel-healthcheck`** — deep periodic audit of codebase + bead graph + dependencies. Run on a cadence after setup completes, not as a setup-failure remedy.

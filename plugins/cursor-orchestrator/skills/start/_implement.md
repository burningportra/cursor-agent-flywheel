# Implementation Phase — Step 7

## Step 7: Implement each bead

### Pre-flight: NTM readiness gate (MANDATORY — run BEFORE Pre-loop)

`NTM_AVAILABLE` and `NTM_PROJECT` are captured in SKILL.md Step 0b but **not persisted to `checkpoint.json`**. After `/compact`, session resume, or any context reset, they are lost — and the implementation loop below will silently fall through to `Agent()` spawning, which strips the user of visible tmux panes. This is the #1 reason NTM "always gets skipped."

**You MUST re-run the detection inline before choosing a spawn mechanism**, even if you think you remember the earlier result. The detection now **auto-symlinks** nested repos silently — only true ambiguity (name-collision) surfaces an `AskUserQuestion`:

```bash
if ! command -v ntm >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "NTM_AVAILABLE=false reason=cli-missing"
else
  NTM_BASE=$(ntm config show 2>/dev/null | awk -F'"' '/^projects_base/ {print $2}')
  PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo "$PWD")
  PROJECT_BASENAME=$(basename "$PROJECT_ROOT")
  TARGET="$NTM_BASE/$PROJECT_BASENAME"

  if [ -z "$NTM_BASE" ]; then
    echo "NTM_AVAILABLE=false reason=no-projects-base"
  elif [ ! -e "$TARGET" ]; then
    # Auto-symlink: nested or sibling repo not yet linked under projects_base.
    # This is the common case (e.g. ~/Documents/GitHub/foo/services/bar — basename=bar
    # not under base=~/Documents/GitHub directly). Silent fix, no user prompt.
    ln -s "$PROJECT_ROOT" "$TARGET" \
      && echo "NTM_AVAILABLE=true project=$PROJECT_BASENAME base=$NTM_BASE action=auto-symlinked" \
      || echo "NTM_AVAILABLE=false reason=symlink-failed target=$TARGET"
  elif [ -L "$TARGET" ] && [ "$(readlink "$TARGET")" = "$PROJECT_ROOT" ]; then
    echo "NTM_AVAILABLE=true project=$PROJECT_BASENAME base=$NTM_BASE action=existing-symlink-ok"
  elif [ "$(realpath "$TARGET" 2>/dev/null)" = "$(realpath "$PROJECT_ROOT" 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    echo "NTM_AVAILABLE=true project=$PROJECT_BASENAME base=$NTM_BASE action=existing-dir-matches"
  else
    # COLLISION: $TARGET exists but points to a different repo. Do NOT clobber.
    echo "NTM_AVAILABLE=false reason=name-collision target=$TARGET points-to=$(readlink -f "$TARGET" 2>/dev/null) want=$PROJECT_ROOT"
  fi
fi
```

**Decision rule** (no silent fallthrough):

- `NTM_AVAILABLE=true` (any `action=*`) → **you MUST use NTM** for this wave. Record `NTM_PROJECT = $PROJECT_BASENAME` and proceed to the NTM branch in step 2 of the Implementation loop. Do NOT spawn via `Agent()` as a shortcut just because the NTM block is longer — the user's visibility into the wave depends on tmux panes, and skipping NTM here silently degrades the flywheel UX.
- `NTM_AVAILABLE=false reason=cli-missing` → NTM not installed. Spawn via `Agent()` (fallback). No user prompt needed.
- `NTM_AVAILABLE=false reason=no-projects-base` → `ntm config show` returned empty. Surface a one-question fix:
  ```
  AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
    question: "NTM is installed but has no projects_base configured. Set it to the parent of this repo?",
    header: "NTM setup",
    options: [
      { label: "Set + auto-symlink (Recommended)", description: "ntm config set projects_base $(dirname \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)\") and re-run the gate" },
      { label: "Fall back to Agent()", description: "Skip NTM this session — agents run invisibly via Agent() tool" },
      { label: "Run /flywheel-setup", description: "Full setup wizard to configure NTM permanently" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }])
  ```
- `NTM_AVAILABLE=false reason=name-collision` → another repo with the same basename is already linked under `projects_base`. Surface the conflict via `AskUserQuestion` (NEVER auto-clobber — destructive):
  ```
  AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
    question: "NTM has a different repo named '$PROJECT_BASENAME' already at $TARGET (resolves to $points-to). What should I do?",
    header: "NTM name collision",
    options: [
      { label: "Use unique label", description: "Replace target name in the spawn with a project-disambiguating label like '$PROJECT_BASENAME-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)'" },
      { label: "Replace symlink", description: "rm $TARGET && ln -s $PROJECT_ROOT $TARGET — destroys the link to the OTHER repo, only safe if it's stale" },
      { label: "Fall back to Agent()", description: "Skip NTM this session — agents run invisibly via Agent() tool" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }])
  ```
- `NTM_AVAILABLE=false reason=symlink-failed` → permission error or other filesystem failure. Surface the error verbatim and fall back to `Agent()`.

### Wave-to-wave reliability (v3.6.0+)

Before starting the wave, decide whether you'll babysit the loop in-chat or hand it off to the durable surfaces. Three tools collapse the manual monitor dance into 1–2 calls and let the loop survive `/compact`, idle turns, and the user walking away:

**1. `tender-daemon` — background watcher (survives `/compact`)**

Spawn ONCE per wave, before dispatching impl agents. It polls inbox + `ntm --robot-is-working` every N seconds and appends NDJSON deltas to `.pi-flywheel/tender-events.log`. On resume, you tail the log to reconstruct what happened while you were gone — no state loss when context is reset.

```bash
nohup node $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/mcp-server/dist/scripts/tender-daemon.js \
  --session=agent-flywheel-plugin--impl-<goal-slug> \
  --project="$PWD" \
  --interval=30000 \
  --logfile=.pi-flywheel/tender-events.log \
  --agent=<your-coordinator-name> \
  > /tmp/tender-daemon.log 2>&1 &
echo "tender_daemon_pid=$!"
```

Event kinds emitted: `tick`, `message_received`, `pane_state_changed`, `rate_limited`, `context_low`, `daemon_stopped`. On wave completion, `kill -TERM <pid>` flushes a `daemon_stopped` event and exits cleanly.

**Tail-on-resume pattern** — when chat re-enters mid-wave, run:
```bash
tail -100 .pi-flywheel/tender-events.log | jq -c '.'
```
to catch up on every state change you missed.

**2. `flywheel_advance_wave` — one-call wave transition**

After every wave completes, instead of: verify-beads → read frontier → render prompts → dispatch (4-step manual dance), call:
```
flywheel_advance_wave(cwd, closedBeadIds: [<wave-N bead IDs>])
```
Returns `{ verification, nextWave: { beadIds, prompts: [{beadId, lane, prompt}], complexity } | null, waveComplete }`. If `nextWave` is non-null, dispatch the rendered prompts to NTM panes via `ntm --robot-send`. If `waveComplete: true` and `nextWave: null`, the queue is drained — proceed to Step 8.

This is the surface that makes the flywheel actually flywheel. Use it after EVERY wave; do not re-implement the dance manually.

**3. `ScheduleWakeup` — coordinator re-entry**

After dispatching a wave, schedule yourself to re-enter in ~5 min so you don't sit idle:
```
ScheduleWakeup(
  delaySeconds: 270,
  prompt: "Continue v3.6.0 impl wave: tail .pi-flywheel/tender-events.log, check inbox for [impl] *done* messages, call flywheel_advance_wave with newly-closed bead IDs.",
  reason: "Re-enter mid-wave to advance after agents deliver"
)
```
Stays inside cache TTL (270s), survives idle turns. Combine with the tender-daemon for full reliability — daemon writes events to disk, ScheduleWakeup brings you back to read them.

**Putting it together** — recommended wave loop:
1. Spawn NTM panes via `ntm spawn`.
2. Spawn tender-daemon as a single background process.
3. Dispatch prompts via `ntm --robot-send` for first-wave dispatch; for subsequent idle-pane "next bead" picks, prefer `ntm assign "$NTM_PROJECT" --auto --strategy=dependency` (it picks the next ready bead off the `bv` graph and registers the assignment in one call).
4. Call `ScheduleWakeup(270s, …)` and end the turn.
5. (Wakeup fires) — `tail .pi-flywheel/tender-events.log` → optionally `ntm work triage --by-track` for an operator-readable view of remaining work → call `flywheel_advance_wave(closedBeadIds)`.
6. Dispatch returned `nextWave.prompts` (or proceed to Step 8 if `waveComplete && nextWave === null`).
7. `kill -TERM $tender_daemon_pid` when the queue drains.

**Supervision mode (optional — choose before dispatching).** Before the first ScheduleWakeup, surface this gate:

```
AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
  question: "How should the swarm be supervised between waves?",
  header: "Supervision",
  options: [
    { label: "Looper-based (Recommended)", description: "ScheduleWakeup(270s) keeps coordination in this Claude session. Cache-warm wakes, no second account burn, knows the goal/plan." },
    { label: "ntm controller", description: "Spawn ntm controller \"$NTM_PROJECT\" --agent-type=cc in pane 0 — a dedicated coordinator agent with built-in --robot-snapshot/--robot-attention loop. Main session can exit cleanly. Trade-off: separate context budget, no goal/plan context unless injected via --prompt template." }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}])
```

- **Looper-based** → continue with the wave loop above.
- **ntm controller** → run `ntm controller "$NTM_PROJECT" --agent-type=cc` (optionally with `--prompt=.pi-flywheel/controller-prompt.md` referencing `{{.Session}}`, `{{.AgentList}}`, `{{.ProjectDir}}` template variables to inject the wave's goal). Tender-daemon still runs. The main session may then either tend alongside or exit; if it exits, the controller drives. If the controller pane dies (`ntm --robot-is-working` returns `gone` AND no Agent Mail traffic for >10 min), climb the stuck-pane ladder (`--robot-smart-restart` → `--robot-smart-restart --hard-kill` → fall back to looper-based supervision).

### Commit-batch fresh-eyes auto-trigger (Pre-flight, v3.17.0+)

Before the first wave dispatches, decide the commit-batch threshold that triggers an auto fresh-eyes review during long impl runs. Surface this gate verbatim:

```
AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
  question: "Set the commit-batch threshold for the auto fresh-eyes review during impl?",
  header: "Batch review",
  options: [
    { label: "Off",          description: "Disable. Only the post-wave gate fires. Same as v3.16.0 behavior" },
    { label: "5 commits",    description: "Tighter cadence — catches issues earlier; more reviewer interrupts" },
    { label: "8 commits (Recommended)", description: "Balanced — large enough to avoid micro-commit noise, small enough to keep reviewer scope bounded" },
    { label: "12 commits",   description: "Looser cadence — fewer interrupts, longer feedback latency" }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}])
```

Route the answer into `state.commitBatchThreshold`. `Off` sets it to `0` (disables); the others set the integer literally. `FW_COMMIT_BATCH_THRESHOLD` env var is an alternative override path — useful for CI / unattended runs where you don't want to surface the gate. Env beats state on conflict.

The threshold drives the `shouldTriggerBatchReview(state)` check inside `flywheel_advance_wave` (see Step 7.5 below).

### Pre-loop — swarm scaling + stagger

**Agent ratio by open-bead count** (from `br ready --json`). Pick the smallest tier that accommodates your wave:

| Open beads | Claude : Codex : Gemini | Notes |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------|
| < 100     | 1 : 1 : 1                | Single rep each — coordination overhead stays low |
| 100-399   | 3 : 3 : 2                | Standard swarm |
| 400+      | 4 : 4 : 2                | Parallel tracks essential |

Claude owns architecture / complex reasoning, Codex owns fast iteration / testing, Gemini provides a second perspective for docs / review. Cap parallel spawns at the wave's independent-bead count — do not spin up agents with nothing to do.

The 1:1:1 (and richer) ratios are now actually executed via the model-diversity split in step 7.2 below — not just documented. CLI availability is detected up-front and missing CLIs degrade gracefully with a user-facing warning.

**Thundering-herd mitigation** — stagger spawns by **30 seconds minimum**. Do NOT spawn all agents simultaneously; they all read AGENTS.md, hit Agent Mail, and query `br ready` at once — piling onto the same frontier bead. Use `run_in_background: true` and wait 30s between each `Agent(...)` call.

**Codex input-buffer quirk** — after the prompt lands in a Codex agent, send Enter TWICE (or append a trailing newline) so the long prompt clears the input buffer.

**Rate-limit management** — if any impl agent reports a rate-limit error (429, "usage limit reached", etc.), invoke `/caam` to switch that model's account. `caam activate <model> <backup-account>` takes <100ms and keeps the wave moving. Don't kill and restart the agent; the wrapper just re-authenticates the current session.

**Structured error branching for monitoring/tool failures.** When a flywheel tool or monitor wrapper returns a structured error, branch on `result.structuredContent?.data?.error?.code` (typed `FlywheelErrorCode`) instead of parsing `error.message` strings:

```ts
const code = monitorResult.structuredContent?.data?.error?.code;
if (code === "exec_timeout") return retryMonitorTick();
if (code === "exec_aborted") return stopWaveCleanly();
if (code === "cli_failure") return escalateWithHint(monitorResult.structuredContent?.data?.error?.hint);
```

**Destructive-command coordination** — if any impl agent proposes `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `DROP TABLE`, `rm -rf`, `kubectl delete`, or similar, invoke `/slb` to require two-person approval. The coordinator is the second party; never let an agent self-approve destructive ops. If `/dcg` is configured as a hook, most of these are already blocked at the harness layer — still confirm via `/slb` for anything slipping through.

**DCG-blocked command workarounds** — when the `/dcg` hook blocks a command, do not try to bypass it. Use the safe equivalent:

| Blocked command                            | Safe alternative                                   | Why it's safer                                     |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `rm -rf <dir> && mkdir <dir>`              | `mkdir -p <dir>-$$` (new temp dir with PID suffix) | No deletion; caller points to the new path         |
| `git checkout HEAD -- <path>`              | `git show HEAD:<path> > <path>`                    | Redirect is reversible; no index manipulation      |
| `git reset --hard <sha>`                   | `git stash && git checkout <sha>`                  | Work is preserved in stash                         |
| `git push --force <branch>`                | `git push --force-with-lease <branch>`             | Aborts if remote advanced since last fetch         |
| `DROP TABLE <t>`                           | `ALTER TABLE <t> RENAME TO <t>_deprecated_<date>`  | Recoverable until the rename is cleaned up later   |
| `rm -rf <dir>`                             | `mv <dir> /tmp/trash-$(date +%s)-<dir-basename>`   | Trashed, not deleted; cleaner scripts gc /tmp      |

If none of these fit, escalate to `/slb` with the full command, expected outcome, and recovery plan. Never `--no-verify`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, or edit `/dcg` config to unblock a single action — those remove the safety net permanently.

### Implementation loop

Use `TaskCreate` to create a task per bead. For each ready bead:

1. Create a named implementation team if multiple beads are parallelizable:
   ```
   TeamCreate(team_name: "impl-<goal-slug>")
   ```
   > **NOTE:** If a planning team (e.g. `"deep-plan-<slug>"`) is still active from Step 5, you must delete it first via `TeamDelete(team_name: "deep-plan-<slug>")` before creating the impl team. If `TeamDelete` fails because agents are still registered, retire them via Agent Mail `retire_agent` first, then retry `TeamDelete`. Alternatively, reuse the existing planning team by passing its `team_name` to impl agents.

2. **Choose spawn mechanism based on NTM availability.**

   **If `NTM_AVAILABLE`** (preferred): Use NTM to spawn impl agents into visible tmux panes. This lets the user observe all agents working in real-time. `ntm spawn` takes a project name (which must be a directory under `projects_base`) and uses `--label` for the per-purpose suffix. Use `$NTM_PROJECT` captured in Step 0b (which equals `basename $PWD`):

   **Model-diversified split (Claude : Codex : Gemini at 1:1:1).** Distribute the wave's beads across the three CLIs so the user gets a second/third model perspective per wave. The split is `floor(N/3)` each plus remainders by priority (claude → codex → gemini).

   1. **Detect CLI availability up-front.** Run `which claude codex gemini` (or call `flywheel_doctor` and read the `claude_cli` / `codex_cli` / `gemini_cli` rows + the `swarm_model_ratio` synthesis). Build a capabilities map. The MCP server exposes `detectCliCapabilities` from `mcp-server/src/adapters/model-diversity.ts` for programmatic callers.

   1a. **Codex config compatibility pre-spawn gate (MANDATORY when lane includes a `cod` pane).** If `DOCTOR_REPORT.checks` shows `codex_config_compat` with severity `yellow` or `red`, surface this gate BEFORE spawning. Skipping it is a known failure mode: cod pane crashes within seconds with `'gpt-5.5-xhigh' model is not supported when using Codex with a ChatGPT account` (verified 2026-05-08).

      ```
      AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
        question: "Doctor flagged codex_config_compat (~/.codex/config.toml model='X' is rejected by ChatGPT-account auth). Apply the fix before spawning?",
        header: "Codex config",
        options: [
          { label: "Apply fix and proceed (Recommended)", description: "Run: flywheel_remediate({checkName: 'codex_config_compat', mode: 'execute', autoConfirm: true}). Idempotent. Then spawn the swarm." },
          { label: "Skip cod from swarm", description: "Re-shape lane sizes to redistribute codex share to claude+gemini. Loses Codex perspective." },
          { label: "Continue anyway", description: "Spawn cod panes despite known incompatibility — they will crash within seconds." }
        ],
        multiSelect: false
      }])
      ```

   1b. **Gemini model compatibility pre-spawn gate (MANDATORY when lane includes a `gem` pane).** If `DOCTOR_REPORT.checks` shows `gemini_model_compat` with severity `yellow` or `red`, surface this gate BEFORE spawning. The 2026-05-15 reality-check swarm confirmed the gemini CLI rejects models outside the documented allowlist (`gemini-3.1-flash-preview`). The check is provided by bead `claude-orchestrator-37n6` — if the check is missing from `DOCTOR_REPORT.checks` entirely, treat it as `green` (no gate) and continue.

      ```
      AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
        question: "Doctor flagged gemini_model_compat (configured gemini model is outside the documented allowlist). How to handle the gem lane?",
        header: "Gemini config",
        options: [
          { label: "Skip gem from swarm (Recommended)", description: "Re-shape lane sizes via substitution ladder (gmi→cod→pi→cc). Loses Gemini perspective but avoids spawn crash." },
          { label: "Continue anyway", description: "Spawn gem panes despite known incompatibility — they will likely reject the configured model and exit." }
        ],
        multiSelect: false
      }])
      ```

      **Looper-driven / `--no-user` contexts (auto-resume, `/agent-flywheel:flywheel-swarm`)** must skip the AskUserQuestion variants above and auto-downgrade silently with a one-line warning to the dispatch log: `⚠ codex_config_compat=<sev>; downgrading --cod=N→0` (and analogous for gemini). Redistribute the dropped share via the substitution ladder (gmi→cod→pi→cc) before computing lane sizes in Step 2.

   2. **Compute the lane sizes** from the capabilities map and the wave size N:
      - All three available: `floor(N/3)` each. N=3 → 1 Claude + 1 Codex + 1 Gemini. N=4 → 2C + 1Co + 1G (claude takes the +1). N=5 → 2C + 2Co + 1G. N=14 → 5C + 5Co + 4G.
      - Missing one CLI (e.g. codex absent): redistribute its share to the surviving providers by priority. Wave of 3 with codex missing → 2 Claude + 1 Gemini, plus a degraded-mode warning to the user.
      - All missing: fail loudly — the wave cannot be dispatched. The doctor's `swarm_model_ratio` row will be red.

   3. **Spawn lanes via NTM** with the correct per-model pane counts. Load `/ntm` and `/vibing-with-ntm` first if you haven't — they carry the canonical orchestrator decision tree, stuck-pane ladder, and command surface this section assumes.
      ```bash
      SESSION="${NTM_PROJECT}--impl-<goal-slug>"

      # --no-user omits pane 0 entirely; lanes start at pane index 1.
      # --stagger-mode=smart prevents thundering-herd on simultaneous cold-boot.
      # Pane-type priority (Changed in v3.17.0 — see AGENTS.md "NTM pane priority"):
      #   mixed cc:cod:gem 1:1:1 is canonical. Substitution ladder when a
      #   provider is unavailable (driven by the Step 1a/1b doctor gates):
      #     missing gmi → reassign to cod
      #     missing cod also → reassign to pi
      #     all three peers unavailable → cc-only floor (explicit override)
      ntm spawn "$NTM_PROJECT" --label impl-<goal-slug> --no-user \
        --cc=<N_claude> --cod=<N_cod> --gmi=<N_gemini> --stagger-mode=smart
      ```

      **Pane addressing is numeric** — `cc-1` / `cod-1` / `gmi-1` style does NOT work. With `--no-user`, panes are laid out contiguously by spawn order:

      | Lane    | Pane indices                                              |
      |---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Claude  | `1` … `N_claude`                                          |
      | Codex   | `N_claude+1` … `N_claude+N_cod`                           |
      | Gemini  | `N_claude+N_cod+1` … `N_claude+N_cod+N_gemini`            |

      Dispatch via `ntm --robot-send` (NOT `ntm send`). Plain `ntm send` aborts with `Continue anyway? [y/N]` when CASS dedup matches a similar past prompt — silent blocker in orchestrator loops (ntm skill gotcha #3). `--robot-send` is non-interactive by design:
      ```bash
      ntm --robot-send="$SESSION" --panes=1 --msg="<claude-tuned prompt>"
      ntm --robot-send="$SESSION" --panes=$((N_claude+1)) --msg="<codex-tuned prompt>"
      ntm --robot-send="$SESSION" --panes=$((N_claude+N_cod+1)) --msg="<gemini-tuned prompt>"
      ```

      **Flag note (verified 2026-05-08).** Use `--panes=N` (plural; indices comma-separated). `--pane=N` (singular) is silently broadcast to ALL panes. Combining `--panes=N --type=cc` AND-restricts to zero matches at session-init time before pane-type metadata stabilizes — drop `--type=` when you already know the index from the spawn order.

      ⚠ **Forbidden in automation:** `ntm view` (retiles the user's tmux layout and returns nothing useful) and `ntm dashboard` / `ntm palette` (human-only TUIs). The user can run them; the orchestrator must not.

   4. **Use the per-model prompt adapters** so each pane gets a prompt tuned to its model:
      - `mcp-server/src/adapters/claude-prompt.ts` — baseline scaffold (matches existing Step 7 template).
      - `mcp-server/src/adapters/codex-prompt.ts` — terser preambles + strict structured `COMPLETION_REPORT` block (per `/codex:gpt-5-4-prompting`). Codex panes also need 2 trailing newlines (input-buffer quirk).
      - `mcp-server/src/adapters/gemini-prompt.ts` — explicit role framing + bounded "STOP after report" guard.
      All three adapters share the `BeadDispatchContext` input shape and the `AdaptedPrompt` output shape so the dispatch loop is a single `adaptPromptFor(lane.provider, ctx)` switch.

   5. **Agent Mail names use the adjective+noun pool** from `mcp-server/src/adapters/agent-names.ts`. Call `allocateAgentNames(N, '<wave-id>')` for collision-free assignment across a 14-bead wave (pool capacity = 1600 unique names). Pass the chosen name as `preferred_name` in the agent's STEP 0 `macro_start_session` call. **Never use descriptive role-style names like `research-coordinator`** — the Agent Mail server rejects them; see `feedback_agent_mail_naming.md` in CASS memory.

   6. **Degraded-mode warning.** When the split returns `degraded: true` (one or more CLIs missing), echo the warning to the user before spawning so they know the wave is not the canonical 1:1:1. Also surface it in the wave-completion summary.

   - Stagger sends by 30 seconds (thundering-herd mitigation still applies).
   - The Agent Mail STEP 0 bootstrap is still MANDATORY in each pane's prompt — NTM handles process lifecycle; Agent Mail handles coordination protocol, file reservations, and audit trail.

   **Monitor loop (MANDATORY — do NOT fire-and-forget).** NTM spawns agents asynchronously; a pane process can live while the agent inside it is idle, crashed, or skipping Agent Mail. You MUST actively monitor until every bead in the wave is closed or force-stopped.

   ⚠ **Do NOT use `ntm status` / `ntm activity` / `ntm health` for monitoring.** They read cached timestamps and silently return stale signals (sometimes dated to the epoch / "56 years ago"), so panes appear dead while they're working (or vice versa). Use the `--robot-*` surfaces below — they sample live pane buffers and the provider's actual OAuth/quota state.

   **Bootstrap once** (capture the event cursor):
   ```bash
   ntm --robot-snapshot --robot-format=toon      # note the returned `cursor`
   ```

   **Tend — event-driven, not timer-driven.** Block on the attention feed instead of polling every 60-90s; it wakes on real state changes (attention, action_required, mail_ack_required, rate_limited-cleared):
   ```bash
   ntm --robot-wait "$SESSION" \
       --wait-until=attention,action_required,mail_ack_required \
       --timeout=90s                               # returns sooner if an event fires
   ```

   **On each wake, read the live per-pane truth (run all 4 — inbox is mandatory, not optional):**

   1. `ntm --robot-is-working="$SESSION"` — `working | idle | rate_limited | error | context_low`
   2. `ntm --robot-agent-health="$SESSION"` — OAuth, quota, context-window, account state
   3. `ntm --robot-tail="$SESSION" --panes=<N> --lines=50` — sample the actual pane buffer for any pane flagged idle/error
   4. **Inbox poll (MANDATORY — this is how you observe agent progress):**
      ```
      fetch_inbox(project_key: cwd, agent_name: "<your-name>", include_bodies: false, status: "unread", limit: 50)
      ```
      Then for each new message:
      - `mark_message_read(message_id: <id>)` — so the next poll shows only fresh traffic.
      - If `subject` matches `[impl] <bead-id> done`, run `acknowledge_message(message_id: <id>)` and treat the bead as a candidate for proactive close (verify commit + acceptance, then `br update --status closed`).
      - If `subject` matches `[impl] <bead-id> blocker`, fetch the body via `fetch_topic`, capture into CASS, and decide: nudge for clarification, reassign, or escalate per Step 9's gates.
   5. `git log --oneline --grep="<bead-id>"` per in-flight bead — catches the "agent committed but forgot `br update`" failure mode (see Step 7's proactive-close rule).

   **Tick log (MANDATORY — print this to the user every wake so they have proof of monitoring).** After running the 5 reads above, emit ONE compact line of plain text in the chat (NOT a tool result, actual user-facing output):

   ```
   tick #<N> @ <HH:MM:SS> — panes: <W working / I idle / R rate-limited> · inbox: <K new> [bead-x9q done by Coral, bead-y3r started by Onyx] · commits: <N since last tick>
   ```

   Skip ticks where nothing changed (don't spam), but emit at least one line every 3 ticks so the user can see the orchestrator is alive. If the inbox count is `0 new` for 3 consecutive ticks AND no panes are `working`, suspect Agent Mail breakage — call `health_check` on the agent-mail server before continuing the loop.

   If the event cursor expires, re-run `ntm --robot-snapshot` and continue.

   **Agent Mail usage verification.** Bootstrap in the prompt is not enough — confirm each pane's agent actually registered AND is messaging:
   1. After 60s post-spawn, call `list_window_identities` (or `list_contacts`) and confirm a registered identity exists per pane you spawned. A missing identity means the agent skipped `macro_start_session`.
   2. On any missing identity, nudge immediately (use `--robot-send` to dodge CASS dedup blocking):
      ```bash
      ntm --robot-send="$SESSION" --panes=<pane> --msg="Before any other work, run macro_start_session and send a 'started' message to <coordinator-name>. Do not skip Agent Mail bootstrap — the flywheel cannot track you otherwise."
      ```
   3. If the agent has an identity but hasn't sent a message in >2 min while its bead is still open, it's silently stuck. Treat as idle (escalation below).

   **Nudge escalation per idle pane.** Cross-reference: this is the [orchestrator decision tree from `/vibing-with-ntm`](references/vibing-with-ntm/SKILL.md#orchestrator-decision-tree) — load that skill if you need full operator-card detail (OC-001 rate-limit probe, OC-003 stuck-pane ladder, OC-009 context handoff, OC-016 convergence termination).

   "Idle" = `ntm --robot-is-working` reports `idle` for the pane OR no Agent Mail traffic in 2 min while bead is open. Treat `rate_limited` and `context_low` as separate recovery paths, NOT idle:
   - `rate_limited` → probe reality first (`tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION":<pane> "ping" Enter; sleep 5; ntm --robot-tail="$SESSION" --panes=<pane> --lines=10`); if still limited, rotate via `/caam` or `ntm rotate "$SESSION" --all-limited`. Do not nudge.
   - `context_low` → dispatch handoff-then-restart: save state via Agent Mail, then `ntm --robot-restart-pane="$SESSION" --panes=<N> --restart-bead=<bead-id>` on a fresh pane.

   For a genuinely idle pane (use `--robot-send`, NOT `ntm send` — see CASS-dedup note above):
   - Nudge 1: `ntm --robot-send="$SESSION" --panes=<pane> --msg="Status check — report progress on <bead-id> and any blockers via Agent Mail."`
   - Nudge 2 (2 min later): `ntm --robot-send="$SESSION" --panes=<pane> --msg="Still waiting on <bead-id>. If blocked, message <coordinator> with the blocker. If done, run 'br update <bead-id> --status closed'."`
   - Nudge 3 (2 min later): `ntm --robot-send="$SESSION" --panes=<pane> --msg="Final nudge. Delivering now or I reassign/close on your behalf."`
   - After 3 nudges AND identical `--robot-tail` output for ≥3 ticks, the pane is wedged (CLI likely hung on `/usage`, `/rate-limit-options`, or a confirm dialog). Climb the stuck-pane ladder instead of blind nudging:
     1. `ntm --robot-health-restart-stuck="$SESSION" --stuck-threshold=10m --dry-run` — surfaces which panes are actually stuck.
     2. `ntm --robot-smart-restart="$SESSION" --panes=<N> --prompt="<re-dispatch prompt>"` — graceful; refuses if pane is actually working.
     3. `ntm --robot-smart-restart="$SESSION" --panes=<N> --hard-kill --prompt="..."` — when the CLI is wedged on a dialog.
     4. `ntm --robot-restart-pane="$SESSION" --panes=<N> --restart-bead=<bead-id>` — nuclear (`tmux respawn-pane -k`); works even when the CLI refuses to cooperate.
     Then apply Step 7's idle-agent escalation (verify commit on disk, close bead yourself if commit matches acceptance, otherwise reassign the bead).

   ⚠ Do NOT use `ntm spawn impl-<goal-slug>` (bare purpose as session name). `ntm` resolves the session name as `projects_base/<session_name>`, and an `impl-<goal-slug>` directory won't exist, so the spawn either fails or lands in the wrong cwd. Always pass the project name as positional arg and the purpose as `--label`.

   **Post-wave bridge — call `flywheel_advance_wave` (v3.6.0+).** When every bead in the wave is closed (via Agent Mail completion OR proactive close OR force-stop), do NOT manually re-render the next wave. One call:
   ```
   flywheel_advance_wave(cwd, closedBeadIds: [<wave-N bead IDs>])
   ```
   - If `nextWave: null` and `waveComplete: true` → queue drained. `kill -TERM $tender_daemon_pid`, leave the tmux session alive (user may want to inspect panes), transition to Step 8.
   - If `nextWave.prompts` returned → dispatch them via `ntm --robot-send` to fresh panes (or reuse idle ones via `--robot-restart-pane`), then `ScheduleWakeup(270s, …)` and end the turn. The daemon will keep logging while you're idle.

   **Do not skip the Step 8 AskUserQuestion review prompt just because you watched the panes succeed** — the user still gets "Looks good / Self review / Fresh-eyes" and fresh-eyes review is still run via `Agent()` (NOT NTM — reviewers are short-lived). See `_review.md`.

   **If NTM is unavailable** (fallback): Spawn via the `Agent()` tool as described below.

3. Spawn an implementation agent with team membership. **Agent Mail bootstrap is ALWAYS required** — every impl agent must register, reserve files, and send start/done messages regardless of isolation mode or file overlap. The message trail creates a coordination audit log for debugging, session history, and CASS memory.

   **Before spawning — pre-flight (populate template placeholders).** Fill these in from the bead before dispatch so the agent doesn't spend turns hunting for context. This matches Opus 4.7's "delegate with full upfront context" guidance — the agent is a capable engineer, not a pair programmer to guide line-by-line.

   | Placeholder | How to compute |
   |-------------|----------------|
   | `<complexity>` | One of `simple` / `medium` / `complex` — must match the runtime `BeadComplexity` type in `mcp-server/src/model-routing.ts`. Prefer calling `classifyBeadComplexity()` directly when available; otherwise use the heuristic in the note below. |
   | `<relevant-files>` | Paths the agent will likely edit/read, derived from bead description + dep traversal. List 3-10; the agent can still discover more. |
   | `<prior-art-beads>` | Up to 3 closed bead IDs with similar titles. Use the shell snippet in the note below. |
   | `<thinking-directive>` | `simple` / `medium` → `Respond quickly; don't overthink — this bead is well-scoped.` `complex` → `Think carefully and step-by-step before writing code; this bead is harder than it looks.` |
   | `<completion-length>` | `simple` → `≤5 bullets`; `medium` → `≤10 bullets`; `complex` → `≤20 bullets`. |

   **Complexity heuristic** (when `classifyBeadComplexity()` isn't available): from `br show <bead-id> --json`:
   - 1 file + ≤3 acceptance items + 0 deps → `simple`
   - 2–4 files OR 1 dep → `medium`
   - 5+ files OR multiple deps OR vague acceptance → `complex`

   **Prior-art lookup** (copy-paste-safe, substitute `<keyword>` with a term from the bead title):

   ```bash
   br list --status closed --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.title | test("<keyword>"; "i")) | .id' | head -3
   ```

   Spawn call:
   ```
   Agent(
     subagent_type: "general-purpose",
     isolation: "worktree",
     name: "impl-<bead-id>",
     team_name: "impl-<goal-slug>",
     prompt: "
       ## STEP 0 — AGENT MAIL BOOTSTRAP (MANDATORY — DO THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE)
       Do NOT read any files or run any commands until all 3 sub-steps below are complete.

       0a. Call macro_start_session(
             human_key: '<cwd>',
             program: 'claude-code',
             model: '<model>',
             task_description: 'Implementing bead <id>: <title>')
           Note your assigned agent name.

       0b. Call file_reservation_paths to reserve every file you plan to edit.
           If any file is already reserved, wait 30 seconds and retry up to 3 times.
           If still blocked after 3 retries, send a message to '<coordinator-agent-name>'
           reporting the conflict, then STOP.

       0c. Send a 'started' message to '<coordinator-agent-name>' via send_message
           with subject '[impl] <bead-id> started'.

       0d. **Re-read AGENTS.md end-to-end** (MANDATORY — do not skip even if
           you think you remember it). Agents that skip this produce
           non-idiomatic code and break project conventions. If the repo has
           no AGENTS.md, note that in your started message.

       0e. **Agent Mail runtime safety.** Use Agent Mail MCP/HTTP tools for inboxes,
           messages, and reservations. Do NOT run mutating `am doctor` commands
           (`repair`, `archive-normalize`, `reconstruct`, `fix`) and do NOT delete
           `.mailbox.activity.lock` or `storage.sqlite3.activity.lock`. The live
           `am serve-http` daemon intentionally holds those locks. If Agent Mail
           reports "Resource is temporarily busy" or looks unhealthy, message the
           coordinator and STOP; the coordinator should run
           `flywheel_remediate({ checkName: "agent_mail_liveness", mode: "execute", autoConfirm: true })`.

       Only after 0a, 0b, 0c, 0d, 0e are ALL complete may you proceed to Step 1.

       ## STEP 0.5 — LOAD MEMORY (if CASS available)
       Call flywheel_memory with operation='search' and query='implementation gotchas <bead-title>'.
       If results returned, review them before starting — they contain lessons from past sessions.

       ## STEP 0.7 — DOMAIN-SKILL LOOKUP (invoke relevant skills BEFORE writing code)
       Scan the bead title + description for domain keywords and invoke the matching skill
       via the Skill tool. Each hit gives you best-practice patterns specific to that stack.

         Bead mentions                            Invoke skill
         -----------------------------------------------------------
         admin, /admin, /api/admin              -> /admin-page-for-nextjs-sites
         A/B test, variant, experiment          -> /ab-testing
         MRR, churn, cohort, customer analytics -> /saas-customer-analytics
         stripe, paypal, checkout, subscription -> /stripe-checkout
         supabase, RLS, drizzle, postgres SaaS  -> /supabase
         tanstack, react-query, react-table     -> /tanstack
         react component, .tsx, JSX             -> /react-component-generator
         og image, twitter card, social preview -> /og-share-images
         TUI, bubble tea, charm, CLI UI         -> /tui-glamorous
         installer, curl|bash, one-liner        -> /installer-workmanship
         CLI automation, atuin, shell history   -> /automating-your-automations
         perf, optimize, bottleneck, p95, p99   -> /extreme-software-optimization
         MCP tool, MCP server                   -> /mcp-server-design
         multi-repo, ru sync                    -> /ru-multi-repo-workflow
         crash, segfault, hang, deadlock        -> /gdb-for-debugging
         playwright, e2e webapp, next.js test   -> /e2e-testing-for-webapps
         fuzz, property-based, crash discovery  -> /testing-fuzzing
         protocol, RFC, conformance             -> /testing-conformance-harnesses
         snapshot, approval, golden output      -> /testing-golden-artifacts
         ML test, oracle-less, metamorphic      -> /testing-metamorphic
         formal proof, lean, rust verification  -> /lean-formal-feedback-loop

       If no keywords match, skip and proceed to STEP 1. Never force a skill invocation on
       an unrelated bead — the lookup is hints, not mandates.

       ## STEP 0.8 — DELEGATION POLICY (Opus 4.7 guidance — read before STEP 1)
       From Anthropic's Opus 4.7 best-practices guide, verbatim:
       > "Do not spawn a subagent for work you can complete directly in a
       > single response (e.g., refactoring a function you can already see).
       > Spawn multiple subagents in the same turn when fanning out across
       > items or reading multiple files."

       Concrete rubric for THIS bead:
       - Scoped to 1 file you can see → do the work in place; do NOT spawn
       - Need to read 5+ files → spawn parallel Explore subagents in ONE turn
       - Ambiguous bug / unclear root cause → spawn ONE codex-rescue for second diagnosis
       - Everything else → in-turn work, no subagents

       ## STEP 1 — IMPLEMENT
       <thinking-directive>

       Title: <bead title>
       Description: <bead description>
       Complexity (coordinator-assigned): <complexity>
       Acceptance criteria: <criteria>

       Likely-relevant files (pre-resolved by coordinator — start here, discover more as needed):
       <relevant-files>

       Prior art (closed beads with similar scope — diff them for patterns before writing new code):
       <prior-art-beads>

       ## STEP 2 — VALIDATE (MANDATORY GATES — all must pass before STEP 3)
       Run in order; fix failures before proceeding. Do NOT commit until all pass.

       2a. **Compile + lint gate** — pick the stack's commands:
           - Rust:       cargo check --all-targets && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo fmt --check
           - Go:         go build ./... && go vet ./...
           - TypeScript: npx tsc --noEmit (plus your eslint / biome script)
                         **AND** run the project's full build: `npm run build` (or `pnpm build`,
                         `yarn build`). `tsc --noEmit` only checks source types — it does NOT
                         verify that tsconfig files, output paths, or scripts referenced from
                         `package.json` actually exist. Running `npm run build` catches missing
                         `tsconfig.*.json` files, missing entry points, and broken script chains.
           - Python:     python -m compileall -q . (plus ruff / mypy per project)
           Check package.json / Cargo.toml / Makefile for project-specific scripts first.

       2a.1. **Reference-resolution gate** — if you added or modified any of:
             - `package.json` scripts (commands that reference files: tsconfig paths, entry points, test runners)
             - Shell commands in CI configs (`.github/workflows/*.yml`, `Makefile`)
             - `import`/`require` statements with new paths
             - Relative paths in config files (`tsconfig.json` `extends`/`references`, `vite.config`, etc.)
             Then verify EVERY referenced path exists on disk before committing:
             ```
             # TypeScript example — after adding "build": "tsc && tsc -p tsconfig.scripts.json"
             test -f tsconfig.scripts.json || echo "MISSING: tsconfig.scripts.json"
             ```
             A bead that wires up a new script must also create the files that script references.

       2b. **Test gate** — run the test suite for files you touched (not the whole suite unless fast).

       2c. **UBS gate** (if `ubs` CLI is installed): `ubs <changed-files>`. Treat
           findings as blocking unless clearly out of scope. If `ubs` is not
           available, note that in your completion report and skip this gate.

       ## STEP 2.5 — STORE LEARNINGS
       If you encountered anything non-obvious during implementation — unexpected API behavior,
       tricky edge cases, workarounds for tooling issues, rebase gotchas, or decisions that
       future agents would benefit from knowing — store each as a CASS memory:
       Call flywheel_memory with operation='store' and content describing the learning.
       Prefix with the bead ID for traceability, e.g.:
       'Bead <id>: <concise learning with enough context to be useful standalone>'
       Skip this step if the implementation was straightforward with no surprises.

       ## STEP 3 — COMMIT & CLOSE BEAD
       Create a commit with a descriptive message referencing bead <id>.
       Then mark the bead closed: `br update <bead-id> --status closed`
       (Note: the br CLI uses `closed`, NOT `done`.)
       **IMPORTANT:** Always use the FULL bead ID (e.g. `my-project-k67`),
       not a short alias. The full ID is project-path-dependent — agents
       running from symlinked or alternative paths will fail to resolve
       short IDs. The coordinator MUST substitute the exact ID from `br list`
       into this prompt template before dispatching.
       Verify the close took effect: `br show <bead-id> --json` and confirm
       `'status': 'closed'`. If the status is anything else, retry the update
       once before continuing to STEP 4. Stragglers are a known failure mode
       and the coordinator will catch them via `flywheel_verify_beads`, but
       verifying here keeps the wave clean.

       ## STEP 3.5 — WRITE COMPLETION ATTESTATION (MANDATORY)
       Write `.pi-flywheel/completion/<bead-id>.json` matching `CompletionReportSchemaV1`
       in `mcp-server/src/completion-report.ts`. This attestation is the ledger entry
       that `flywheel_verify_beads` reads and `flywheel_advance_wave` gates on
       (warn-only by default; hard-block when `FW_ATTESTATION_REQUIRED=1`).
       Worked example:

       ```json
       {
         \"version\": 1,
         \"beadId\": \"<bead-id>\",
         \"agentName\": \"<your-agent-name>\",
         \"paneName\": \"<your-pane-name-or-omit>\",
         \"status\": \"closed\",
         \"changedFiles\": [\"path/relative/to/repo.ts\"],
         \"commits\": [\"<short-sha>\"],
         \"ubs\": { \"ran\": true, \"summary\": \"clean\", \"findingsFixed\": 0, \"deferredBeadIds\": [] },
         \"verify\": [{ \"command\": \"npm test\", \"exitCode\": 0, \"summary\": \"all green\" }],
         \"selfReview\": { \"ran\": true, \"summary\": \"no regressions\" },
         \"beadClosedVerified\": true,
         \"reservationsReleased\": true,
         \"createdAt\": \"<ISO-8601 timestamp>\"
       }
       ```

       Docs-only diffs: set `ubs.ran=false` and a non-empty `ubs.skippedReason`.
       Status `closed` requires `beadClosedVerified=true`. Schema rejects absolute
       paths or `..`-traversal in `changedFiles`. The schema is `version: 1` and
       additive forever — never remove keys.

       ## STEP 4 — RELEASE + REPORT (MANDATORY)
       4a. Release all file reservations via release_file_reservations.
       4b. Send a completion summary to '<coordinator-agent-name>' via send_message
           with subject '[impl] <bead-id> done' (target <completion-length>) including:
           - Files changed
           - Tests added/modified
           - UBS result + verify outcomes + one-line self-review
           - Confirmation that `.pi-flywheel/completion/<bead-id>.json` is written
           - Any open concerns or follow-ups
     "
   )
   ```

3. **Auto-capture failures**: If an agent reports a blocker or failure via Agent Mail, automatically store it in CASS:
   ```
   flywheel_memory(operation: "store", content: "Bead <id> (<title>) hit blocker: <failure description>. Resolution: <what fixed it or 'unresolved'>")
   ```
   This ensures future sessions can recall what went wrong and avoid the same pitfall.

4. Mark the bead's task as `in_progress`. If the agent goes idle before reporting back, nudge it:
   ```
   SendMessage(to: "impl-<bead-id>", message: "Please report your current status and any blockers.")
   ```

   **Proactive close (recommended — skip the escalation tree entirely).** Instead of waiting for 2 nudges to diagnose an idle agent, poll `git log --grep="<bead-id>" --oneline -1` every 30s after spawn. As soon as a commit referencing the bead appears AND the agent is idle (per `TaskList`), verify the commit's diff matches the bead's acceptance criteria, then close the bead yourself:
   ```bash
   br update <bead-id> --status closed
   br show <bead-id> --json | jq -r '.[0].status'   # must print "closed"
   ```
   This saves ~60s per bead (no nudge round-trip) and handles the dominant failure mode (agent commits but skips `br update`) without any dialog. Only fall into the idle-agent escalation tree below when the coordinator could NOT verify the commit OR the bead's acceptance is ambiguous.

   **Monitor-script hygiene.** When using the `Monitor` tool to poll for commits/files/bead-closures, the shell loop MUST end with `exit 0` explicitly — a `for i in $(seq ...); do ... break; done` with no trailing statement inherits the exit code of the last iteration's `sleep` command, which can be non-zero on timeout and fires a spurious `script failed (exit 1)` notification. Pattern:
   ```bash
   for i in $(seq 1 90); do
     if condition_met; then echo "DONE"; exit 0; fi
     sleep 15
   done
   echo "timeout"
   exit 0   # <- required; timeout is not a failure
   ```

   **Idle-agent escalation** (fallback when proactive close doesn't apply): After 2 nudges, check `git log --oneline --grep="<bead-id>"` to determine what shape of failure you're in. There are TWO common cases — diagnose first, then act:

   **Case A — Commits exist but bead not closed** (MORE common): The agent did the implementation work and committed, then went idle before calling `br update --status closed`. Verify:
   ```
   br show <bead-id> --json | jq -r '.[0].status'
   ```
   If status is `open` or `in_progress` but a commit referencing the bead exists:
   - Close the bead directly: `br update <bead-id> --status closed`. No replacement agent needed.
   - Skip the nudge — it saves a round-trip.
   - Optionally verify the commit's diff matches the bead's acceptance criteria before closing.

   **Case B — Zero commits since spawning**: The agent stalled before producing any output.
   - Do NOT spawn a replacement agent — it will likely stall the same way.
   - Implement the bead directly as the coordinator.
   - Close the bead: `br update <bead-id> --status closed`.
   - This is faster than multiple failed spawn cycles and produces the same outcome.

5. **Store cross-cutting learnings**: When an agent's completion report mentions something non-obvious (unexpected file renames, rebase conflicts, API quirks, tooling workarounds), store it in CASS:
   ```
   flywheel_memory(operation: "store", content: "Bead <id> (<title>): <learning from agent report>")
   ```
   Don't store routine completions — only surprises or gotchas that would help future sessions.

6. When the agent completes, mark task as `completed`. Send shutdown:
   ```
   SendMessage(to: "impl-<bead-id>", message: {"type": "shutdown_request", "reason": "Bead complete."})
   ```
   > **Important:** Structured shutdown messages CANNOT be broadcast to `"*"`. You must send to each impl agent individually by name. This applies to all structured JSON messages (shutdown_request, plan_approval_request, etc.).

   **If the agent remains idle after shutdown_request** (check via `TaskList` — task still shows as active after 60 seconds):
   - Force-stop with `TaskStop(task_id: "<saved-task-id>")` if the task ID is available.
   - Retire in Agent Mail: `retire_agent(project_key: cwd, agent_name: "<their-agent-mail-name>")`.
   - If still listed in the team, edit `~/.claude/teams/<team>/config.json` to remove from the `"members"` array, then retry `TeamDelete` when ready.

### Step 7.5: Commit-batch fresh-eyes auto-trigger (v3.17.0+)

When `state.commitBatchThreshold` is set to a positive integer (via the Pre-flight gate above or `FW_COMMIT_BATCH_THRESHOLD`), `flywheel_advance_wave` checks the accumulated commit count between waves. If the count ≥ threshold, it returns:

```ts
{ verification, nextStep: { kind: "batch_review_due", reviewSha: "<HEAD-sha>", lastBaselineSha: "<state.lastBatchReviewSha>" }, waveComplete: false }
```

INSTEAD of the usual `{ nextWave, waveComplete }`. The coordinator MUST handle the `batch_review_due` branch before dispatching the next wave:

1. **Dispatch the review.** Call `flywheel_review` with `action: "batch_review"`, passing the sha range `<lastBaselineSha>..<reviewSha>`. The tool builds the fresh-eyes prompt via `buildFreshEyesPrompt({ emitStructuredFindings: true, shaRange, … })` (from `gates.ts`) and dispatches to either an NTM pane (preferred — reuses warm context from the implementor's pane) or a fresh `Agent()` subagent (fallback when NTM is unavailable / panes dead).

2. **Wait for the verdict.** The review subagent writes structured JSON to `.pi-flywheel/batch-reviews/<sha-range>.json`. Tail the file or poll on next ScheduleWakeup tick. Verdict shape (validated by `BatchReviewVerdictSchema`):
   ```json
   { "status": "pass" | "needs_attention" | "blocking", "findings": [...], "sha_range": "<from>..<to>" }
   ```

3. **Branch on `verdict.status`:**

   - **`pass`** → reset `state.commitBatchCounter = 0`, advance `state.lastBatchReviewSha = reviewSha`, continue to the next `flywheel_advance_wave` call. No user prompt.

   - **`needs_attention`** → surface the findings via:
     ```
     AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
       question: "Batch review (<sha-range>): <N> findings. <one-line summary>. What next?",
       header: "Review",
       options: [
         { label: "Continue waves",     description: "Acknowledge the findings; advance to next wave anyway" },
         { label: "Synthesize beads",   description: "Run br create for each finding (treat as if verdict were blocking)" },
         { label: "Pause to fix",       description: "Stop here so you can inspect + fix manually" },
         { label: "Regress to plan",    description: "Findings show plan-level rework needed; return to Step 5.6" }
       ],
       multiSelect: false
     }])
     ```

   - **`blocking`** → `review.ts` ALREADY called `synthesizeBeadsFromFindings(cwd, state, verdict.findings, sha_range)`; bead IDs sit in `state.batchReviewSynthesizedBeads[sha_range]`. The nextStep is `{ kind: "synthesized_beads_pending", beadIds, mapping }`. The coordinator surfaces the four-option approve/reject gate:

     ```
     AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
       question: "Batch review surfaced <N> findings; auto-synthesized <N> beads (IDs above). How to proceed?",
       header: "Synthesized",
       options: [
         { label: "Approve all",     description: "Merge every bead into the active wave. They become the next dispatch frontier" },
         { label: "Approve subset",  description: "Pick which beads to keep via a follow-up multi-select gate; rejected ones are rolled back" },
         { label: "Reject all",      description: "Roll back every synthesized bead. Counter resets; wave continues from where it was" },
         { label: "Regress to plan", description: "Findings show plan-level rework needed; return to Step 5.6" }
       ],
       multiSelect: false
     }])
     ```

     - **Approve all** → merge bead IDs into `state.activeBeadIds`, advance baseline, continue.
     - **Approve subset** → run a multi-select follow-up gate. List ≤4 beads per page with labels `<bead-id>: <title> [<severity>]`. Multi-select keeps the chosen IDs; the unchosen ones go to `rollbackSynthesizedBeads(cwd, unchosenIds)`. When there are more than 4 beads, paginate through batches of 4.
     - **Reject all** → call `rollbackSynthesizedBeads(cwd, state.batchReviewSynthesizedBeads[sha_range])`. Returns `{ deleted: [...], closed: [...], failed: [...] }`. The rollback tries `br delete <id>` first; on error, falls back to `br update <id> --status closed --notes "rejected via batch-review approve/reject gate"`. (Note: `br update` uses `--notes`, not `--reason`.) Surface the `failed` list to the user if non-empty.
     - **Regress to plan** → mark synthesized beads as closed (rollback semantics), return to Step 5.6.

4. **Race protection.** The baseline (`state.lastBatchReviewSha`) advances to `reviewSha` at DISPATCH time, NOT after the verdict lands. This prevents commits arriving during the review window from double-triggering the next batch.

5. **Timeout.** If the verdict file doesn't appear within 10 min, record `verdict: "review_timeout"`, reset the counter, advance baseline, and resume waves. A timed-out reviewer is not a blocker — the post-wave gate still fires later.

### Parallel-wave build-artifact races

When multiple impl beads in the same wave all trigger `npm run build` (or equivalent), each rebuilds `dist/` or its output directory. Byte-identical outputs are fine — git only sees one change — but **different commit orderings can confuse `git blame`** (bead B's commit may ship bead A's dist/ and vice versa).

**Recommended pattern:**
- Designate ONE bead per wave as the "build-committer" — only that bead commits `dist/`. Other beads commit src/ only.
- Alternative: defer the `dist/` commit to Step 9.5 wrap-up, where the coordinator runs one final `npm run build` and commits the bumped output alongside the version bump. This is the pattern used by v3.4.0 — clean git log, no cross-bead confusion.

If you observe two beads committing the same `dist/` bytes, note it in the end-of-turn summary but do NOT retroactively squash — the history is accurate and future bisects still land on the correct src/.

### Stuck-swarm diagnostics

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Multiple agents pick the same bead | Unsynced starts; not marking `in_progress` early | Stagger starts 30s; require `br update --status in_progress` + Agent Mail claim before any edit; audit file reservations |
| Agent circles after compaction | Forgot the AGENTS.md contract | Nudge: `SendMessage(to: "<name>", message: "Re-read AGENTS.md so it's still fresh, then continue from your last Agent Mail message.")` — kill+restart only if it stays erratic |
| Bead sits `in_progress` too long | Crash / blocker / lost plot | Check Agent Mail thread for last report; if silent, implement directly as coordinator OR split the blocker into sub-beads with `br create` + `br dep add` |
| Contradictory implementations across beads | Poor coordination / stale reservations | Audit `file_reservation_paths`; revise bead boundaries so two beads never edit the same file |
| Much code, goal still far | Strategic drift | Run the "Come to Jesus" reality check in Step 9's Check-status option |

### Codex-rescue handoff on impl-agent stall (per bead `agent-flywheel-plugin-1qn`)

Worker stalls — distinct from `rate_limited` / `context_low` recovery paths above — fire when the same impl bead has hit its retry budget without producing a passing commit. Detect at the **N-1th** retry, not the Nth, so the user has time to choose a different lane:

- An impl agent reported the same `FlywheelErrorCode` (e.g. `cli_failure`, `parse_failure`) on the immediately prior attempt AND the next attempt would be the second retry, **OR**
- The pane has been `idle` per `ntm --robot-is-working` for >5 min after Nudge 2 with zero new commits referencing the bead, **OR**
- A bead has been reassigned twice and the third attempt is about to start.

When any one of these triggers, surface the rescue choice — don't blind-retry:

```
AskUserQuestion(questions: [{
  question: "Bead <id> has stalled (<error_code> twice; hint: <hint from envelope>). How do you want to proceed?",
  header: "Impl stall",
  options: [
    { label: "Retry once more", description: "Spend the final retry on the same lane — sometimes a transient flake clears" },
    { label: "Hand off to Codex (Recommended)", description: "Build a rescue packet from the failing envelope + git diff and invoke the codex-rescue skill" },
    { label: "Abort phase", description: "Stop this bead; mark blocked and move to the next ready bead" },
    { label: "Other", description: "Describe a different recovery path" }
  ],
  multiSelect: false
}])
```

**On "Hand off to Codex"** — build a `RescuePacket` and dispatch via the existing codex prompt adapter. The packet contract lives in `mcp-server/src/codex-handoff.ts`; this section consumes that surface and `mcp-server/src/adapters/codex-prompt.ts` (do NOT edit either):

```ts
import { buildRescuePacket, renderRescuePromptForCodex, formatRescueEventForMemory }
  from '../mcp-server/dist/codex-handoff.js';

// 1. Dump the in-flight diff + last error envelope as the artifact.
//    The artifact path is what Codex reads first — make it concrete.
const artifactPath = `.pi-flywheel/rescue/impl-${beadId}-${Date.now()}.diff`;
fs.writeFileSync(artifactPath, await execStr('git', ['diff', baseSha, 'HEAD']));

const packet = buildRescuePacket({
  phase: 'impl',
  goal: bead.title,
  artifact_path: artifactPath,
  error_code: lastError.code,             // from the prior FlywheelToolError
  hint: lastError.hint ?? '',             // VERBATIM from bead 478 hint contract
  recent_tool_calls: state.recentToolCalls.slice(-10),
  proposed_next_step: 'Apply a minimal fixup; do not rewrite the bead. Run npm run build && tests after the patch.',
});

const adapted = renderRescuePromptForCodex(packet, {
  coordinatorName: '<your-agent-mail-name>',
  projectKey: process.env.NTM_PROJECT,
  rescueAgentName: '<adjective+noun from agent-names pool>',
});

// 2. Invoke /codex:rescue with the rendered prompt body. Use --wait
//    (foreground) so the rescue blocks the wave's progression for this bead.
//    Codex panes need 2 trailing newlines per AdaptedPrompt.trailingNewlines.
```

**Persist the rescue event to CASS** for the doctor's `rescues_last_30d` synthesis:

```
flywheel_memory(operation: "store", content: formatRescueEventForMemory(packet))
```

**On Codex completion:**

- Codex returns a unified diff in its `COMPLETION_REPORT` block. Apply via `git apply --3way` and create a `fixup!` commit referencing the bead. Re-run the impl gate (`npm run build`, tests) before closing.
- If Codex produced a clarifying question, surface it via `AskUserQuestion` and feed the answer back to the original impl agent (or to a fresh one if the stall pane is wedged).
- If Codex itself stalls, do NOT cascade — fall back to "Abort phase" and reassign the bead manually next session.

> ## MANDATORY POST-IMPLEMENTATION CONTINUATION
>
> After all impl agents in the current wave have completed (or been force-stopped), you MUST continue to Step 8 (read `_review.md`). Do NOT end the turn, exit the workflow, or return control to the user. The implementation phase is the MIDDLE of the flywheel — not the end. The remaining steps (review -> verify -> test coverage -> UI polish -> wrap-up -> CASS -> refine -> post-flywheel menu) are what make the flywheel a flywheel. Dropping out here is a bug.

description: Show current flywheel status, bead progress, and inbox messages.

**First action:** Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for `--json`. If `--json`, call the underlying status assembly (checkpoint + `br list --json` + `bv --json` + `fetch_inbox` + calibration) and print a single JSON envelope `{tool:"flywheel_status", version, status, phase, data:{checkpoint, beads, inbox, calibration, duel}}` to stdout, then exit. Otherwise render the human-friendly sections below.

Show flywheel status for this project.

## --json output schema

When invoked with `--json`, this command emits to stdout a single JSON envelope
combining checkpoint, live beads, inbox, and calibration data. Pin the contract
shape via `flywheel_capabilities` (`data.contract_version`).

Top-level: `{tool:"flywheel_status", version, status, phase, data}`
Status:    `"ok" | "error"` (errors carry `data.kind:"error"` + `data.error.{code,message,hint,try_this,retryable}`)
`data` keys: `checkpoint`, `beads[]`, `inbox[]`, `calibration?`, `duel?`.


1. **Checkpoint**: Read `.pi-flywheel/checkpoint.json`. Display:
   - Current phase
   - Selected goal
   - Bead progress (completed/total)
   - Time elapsed in current phase (from `phaseStartedAt`)
   - Polish convergence score (if in planning phase)

2. **Live beads**: Run `br list --json` via Bash. Display a table:
   ```
   ID | Title | Status | Priority | Review passes
   ```
   Group by: in_progress → open → closed/deferred.

3. **Inbox**: Call `fetch_inbox` via the `agent-mail` MCP tool with `agent_name: "Orchestrator"`. Display any messages from running agents. Acknowledge read messages by calling `acknowledge_message` for each.

4. **Todos**: Display current todo list from TodoRead.

5. **Next recommended bead**: Run `bv --robot-next` via Bash to get the next optimal bead to work on.

5.5. **Active duel detection**: Check for `WIZARD_*.md` artifacts in cwd:
   ```bash
   ls WIZARD_IDEAS_*.md WIZARD_SCORES_*.md WIZARD_REACTIONS_*.md DUELING_WIZARDS_REPORT.md 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If any exist, surface a one-line indicator with the inferred phase:
   - `WIZARD_IDEAS_*.md` only → `Active duel: ideation in progress (<N> agents posted)`
   - `WIZARD_SCORES_*.md` present → `Active duel: cross-scoring`
   - `WIZARD_REACTIONS_*.md` present → `Active duel: reveal phase`
   - `DUELING_WIZARDS_REPORT.md` present and >1KB → `Duel complete: see <path> for synthesis`
   - Mtime of newest WIZARD_*.md is >7 days old → append `(stale — run /flywheel-cleanup to flag)`

   Pull `--mode=` from the last line of the most recent `WIZARD_IDEAS_*.md` (the duel skill writes its mode in a header line) and surface it. Do NOT auto-clean or delete artifacts — this is read-only status.

For per-template calibration ratios, see the Calibration section below.

6. **Calibration**: Read `.pi-flywheel/calibration.json`. When it exists AND `totalBeadsConsidered ≥ 3`, render the top 3 rows sorted by `sampleCount` descending:

   ```
   ── Calibration (last <sinceDays> days, <totalBeadsConsidered> closed beads) ──────
     template          mean    p50     p95     ratio   n
     add-tool          1.8h    1.5h    4.2h    1.4× ▲  12
     add-feature       0.6h    0.5h    1.1h    1.1×    23
     fix-bug           0.4h    0.3h    0.9h    0.9× ▼  18
     (N more templates below n≥3 threshold)
   ```

   Marker rules:
   - `▲` when `ratio > 1.25` (under-estimated — work takes longer than expected)
   - `▼` when `ratio < 0.8` (over-estimated — work finishes faster than expected)
   - No marker when `0.8 ≤ ratio ≤ 1.25` (well-calibrated)

   Render times as hours rounded to one decimal (e.g. `1.8h`) using `meanMinutes / 60`, `medianMinutes / 60`, `p95Minutes / 60`.

   If `lowConfidence: true` rows exist in the top-3, append `(n=K)` suffix and note `*low confidence*` beside the row.

   If calibration data is older than 30 days (compare `generatedAt` to today), append:
   > Calibration data is N days old — run /flywheel-calibrate to refresh

   If `.pi-flywheel/calibration.json` is missing OR `totalBeadsConsidered < 3`: omit the section entirely (do not render an empty header).

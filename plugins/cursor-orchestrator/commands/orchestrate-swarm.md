description: Launch a parallel swarm of agents to implement multiple beads simultaneously.
---

Launch a parallel swarm of implementation agents. $ARGUMENTS

1. Call `orch_approve_beads` with `action: "start"` via the `orchestrator` MCP tool. This returns the list of ready beads.

2. If no beads are ready, say "No beads are ready for implementation. Run /cursor-orchestrator:orchestrate to create a plan first."

3. Ask the user: "How many agents should run in parallel? (Recommended: 2-4)"

4. **Setup coordination:**
   - Bootstrap Agent Mail: `macro_start_session(human_key: cwd, program: "cursor", model: your-model, task_description: "Swarm: <goal>")`
   - Create a team: `TeamCreate(team_name: "swarm-<goal-slug>")`

5. For each ready bead (up to the user's limit), create a dedicated **git worktree** (Cursor has no `isolation: "worktree"` on **Task**—use explicit `git worktree add` like **`orchestrate`** Step 7), then create a task and spawn an agent:
   - `TaskCreate(subject: "Impl: <bead-id> <title>", status: "in_progress")`
   - Save the task ID
   ```
   Task(
     subagent_type: "general-purpose",
     name: "impl-<bead-id>",
     team_name: "swarm-<goal-slug>",
     run_in_background: true,
     prompt: "
       You work ONLY under the git worktree at: <worktree-path> (cd there first).

       ## Agent Mail Bootstrap
       Call macro_start_session(human_key: '<cwd>', program: 'cursor', model: '<your-tier-B-Cursor-model>',
         task_description: 'Implementing bead <id>: <title>')
       Note your assigned agent name for messaging.

       ## File Reservation
       Before editing any files, call file_reservation_paths with the files you plan to modify.
       Release reservations when done: release_file_reservations.

       ## Bead: <id> — <title>
       <description>

       ## Acceptance criteria
       <criteria>

       ## On completion
       Send a completion message to <your-coordinator-name> via send_message.
     "
   )
   ```
   **Save each agent's task ID** — needed for `TaskStop` if they become unresponsive.

6. **Monitor swarm:**
   - If an agent goes idle without reporting completion, nudge it: `SendMessage(to: "impl-<bead-id>", message: "Please report your current status and any blockers.")`
   - Use `TaskList` to see overall swarm task status.
   - Use `TaskStop(task_id: "<id>")` to force-stop an unresponsive agent.

7. As each agent completes:
   - Update task: `TaskUpdate(taskId: "<task-id>", status: "completed")`
   - Shutdown agent: `SendMessage(to: "impl-<bead-id>", message: {"type": "shutdown_request", "reason": "Bead complete."})`
   - Do NOT broadcast shutdown to `"*"` — send to each agent individually.

8. Report: "Swarm launched: N agents working on N beads. Use `/cursor-orchestrator:orchestrate-swarm-status` to monitor progress."

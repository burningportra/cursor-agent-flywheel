/**
 * Regression test for claude-orchestrator-6bxt.
 *
 * Step 0c of `skills/start/SKILL.md` must surface failing doctor checks when
 * the overall severity is either yellow OR red — not red-only. Prior wording
 * gated the per-check list on `overall === "red"`, which silently hid
 * `checkpoint_validity` and `codex_config_compat` yellow rows that materially
 * affected the 2026-05-15 session. This test guards against drift back to
 * red-only.
 *
 * Markdown lint, not unit — Step 0c is markdown prose interpreted by the LLM,
 * so we assert the document carries the canonical phrasing rather than test a
 * runtime function.

/**
 * Built-in bead templates for common, repeatable work units.
 *
 * ## The five-block `descriptionTemplate` pattern
 *
 * Every template description follows this structure:
 *
 * ```
 * {{leadSentence — what is being done and where}}
 *
 * Why this bead exists:
 * - {{rationale line 1}}
 * - {{rationale line 2}}
 *
 * Acceptance criteria:
 * - [ ] {{criterion 1}}
 * - [ ] {{criterion 2}}
 * - [ ] {{criterion 3}}
 *
 * ### Files:
 * - {{primaryFile}}
 * - {{secondaryFile}}
 * ```
 *
 * **Why this pattern matters:**
 * - `validateBeads()` scans for `### Files:` to verify file scope and for
 *   `- [ ]` markers to count acceptance criteria; descriptions missing
 *   either trigger template-hygiene warnings.
 * - The lead sentence maps to the one-line `summary` shown when
 *   `formatTemplatesForPrompt()` lists available templates.
 * - The "Why this bead exists" block gives the executing agent rationale
 *   so it can make better judgment calls at the edges.
 *
 * ## Placeholder naming conventions
 *
 * - Use **camelCase** names that describe the semantic role, not the format.
 * - Good: `implementationFile`, `testFile`, `bugSummary`, `endpointPurpose`
 * - Bad: `file`, `desc`, `impl`, `f1`
 * - Placeholder `description` fields should explain the *role* the value
 *   plays ("Primary source file to edit or create"), not the format
 *   ("a string").
 *
 * ## `acceptanceCriteria` vs template `- [ ]` lines
 *
 * These serve different audiences and are not required to be identical:
 *
 * - **Template `- [ ]` lines** (inside `descriptionTemplate`) are
 *   *bead-facing*: filled with placeholder values at expansion time and
 *   read by the executing agent as concrete, contextual checkboxes.
 * - **`acceptanceCriteria` array** (on the template object) is
 *   *template-level metadata*: used by validation tooling, template
 *   listings, and audit checks. These are generic descriptions of what
 *   any bead from this template must achieve.
 *
 * Both must exist. The template-level criteria provide a stable contract;
 * the expanded `- [ ]` lines provide the agent-specific, filled-in version.
 *
 * ## How to add a new bead template
 *
 * 1. Pick a `verb-noun` ID in kebab-case matching `/^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/`
 *    (e.g., `fix-bug`, `add-migration`, `write-docs`).
 * 2. Write `descriptionTemplate` following the five-block pattern above.
 * 3. Define one placeholder per `{{marker}}` used in the template — all
 *    placeholders that appear in the template text must have `required: true`.
 * 4. Populate `acceptanceCriteria` with >= 3 specific, verifiable items.
 * 5. Set `filePatterns` to the narrowest globs that cover the typical
 *    file scope — prefer specific directory globs over broad wildcards.
 * 6. Write `dependencyHints` naming what this bead typically unblocks
 *    and what it depends on.
 * 7. Add at least one `examples` entry using a different domain than the
 *    placeholder examples to show the template in a realistic context.
 * 8. Wrap the template object with `defineTemplate()` — it catches
 *    placeholder mismatches (used-but-not-defined, defined-but-not-used)
 *    at load time so errors surface immediately, not at expansion time.
 * 9. Run `npm run build` — zero TypeScript errors required.
 *
 * ## When to create a template vs use custom descriptions
 *
 * - **Create a template** when the bead shape occurs 3+ times per typical
 *   session — the repetition justifies the upfront cost of defining
 *   placeholders and examples.
 * - **Use custom descriptions** for rare, project-specific, or highly
 *   variable work where a template would be too generic to add value.

        description: `Update the database connection pool configuration in src/db/config.ts to support environment-based pool sizing for production, staging, and development. Add input validation for the new values, document migration steps, and ensure existing environments are not broken by the change.

Why this bead exists:
- The database connection pool configuration needs to change to support environment-based pool sizing for production, staging, and development.
- Configuration changes without migration notes risk breaking existing deployments silently.

Migration notes:
Existing deployments using the default pool size of 10 continue to work unchanged. To opt in to environment-based sizing, set DB_POOL_MIN and DB_POOL_MAX environment variables. Production defaults to min=5, max=20; staging defaults to min=2, max=10; development defaults to min=1, max=5. If neither variable is set, the legacy default of 10 is preserved.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Add or update the database connection pool configuration in src/db/config.ts with input validation for new values.
- [ ] Document migration steps so existing environments can adapt without downtime or data loss.
- [ ] Add validation tests in src/db/config.test.ts covering valid inputs, invalid inputs, and backwards-compatible defaults.

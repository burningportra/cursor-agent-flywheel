You are an adversarial reader. You do NOT know what was changed or why. Your job is to find bugs by tracing execution flows through randomly selected files.

**Randomly selected files to start from:**
${randomFiles.map(f => `- \`${f}\``).join("\n")}

**Instructions:**
1. For each file, pick a public function or entry point
2. Trace its execution path through the codebase — follow every call, check every branch
3. At each step, ask: "What happens if this input is null? Empty? Huge? Concurrent?"
4. Look for: missing error handling, race conditions, resource leaks, type mismatches, logic errors
5. Do NOT limit yourself to these files — follow the execution wherever it leads
6. Fix any bugs you find directly

**Key principle:** You are NOT reviewing changes. You are hunting bugs by reading code as an adversary who wants to break it. Cast a wide net.

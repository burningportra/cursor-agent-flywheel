# AGENTS.md

Guidance for sub-agents working in this repository.

## Cursor port (this plugin — default)

When coordinating from **Cursor** (`program: "cursor"` in Agent Mail):

| Concern | Canonical source |
|---------|------------------|
| User menus | **`AskQuestion`** + `data.askQuestion` from gate MCP tools — see [`rules/cursor-user-gates.mdc`](rules/cursor-user-gates.mdc) |
| Models | Cursor tiers only — [`rules/orchestrator-cursor-models.mdc`](rules/orchestrator-cursor-models.mdc) (incl. outcome grader Task) |
| Parallel implement | **Task** + git worktrees + Agent Mail — [`commands/flywheel-swarm.md`](commands/flywheel-swarm.md), [`rules/cursor-swarm.mdc`](rules/cursor-swarm.mdc) |
| Bead approval gates | **`flywheel_bead_approval_gate`** — after `br create`: review / score / polish / launch **AskQuestion** menus ([`_beads.cursor.md`](skills/start/_beads.cursor.md), slash: **`/flywheel-beads-review`**) |
| Impl supervision | **`flywheel_impl_tick`** — ~4 min loop: commits → fresh-eyes Task → beads → next wave ([`_implement.cursor.md`](skills/start/_implement.cursor.md)) |
| Resume in-flight beads | [`commands/flywheel-resume.md`](commands/flywheel-resume.md) — not `_inflight_prompt.md` |
| Context budget | [`rules/context-budget.mdc`](rules/context-budget.mdc) — `observe` → `start_ceremony` → phase skills one at a time |

**NTM / tmux / Codex CLI** are **opt-in** only: set `FW_IMPL_BACKEND=ntm` or `FW_DUEL_BACKEND=ntm` and read `skills/legacy/ntm/*` from disk. Do not treat NTM as the default in this plugin.

## Upstream / NTM appendix

The sections below (e.g. **NTM is mandatory**) describe the upstream Claude-orchestrator plugin. They apply when `FW_IMPL_BACKEND=ntm` or when syncing from `burningportra/agent-flywheel-plugin`, not to the default Cursor path above.

## Project Overview

agent-flywheel is an MCP server that drives a multi-phase development workflow: scan, discover, plan, implement, review. The MCP server runs over stdio (JSON-RPC) from `mcp-server/src/server.ts`.

## 30-second map

Cold-reader affordance. Each bullet links to an existing section below.

- **Project-local skills** — see [`Available CLI Tools`](#available-cli-tools), [`SKILL.md linting`](#skillmd-linting), and `skills/` (project-local skill bodies loaded via `flywheel_get_skill`).
- **MCP tools** — see [`MCP tools quick reference`](#mcp-tools-quick-reference) for the at-a-glance index, then version-sliced sections (`v3.7.0`, `v3.11.0`, `v3.12.0`) for change history.
- **Swarm path** — see [`NTM is mandatory for all spawned work`](#ntm-is-mandatory-for-all-spawned-work) + [`Agent Coordination`](#agent-coordination) + [`Bead Lifecycle`](#bead-lifecycle). Quick recipe: `ntm spawn <project> --label <purpose> --no-user --cc=N --cod=M --stagger-mode=smart` → `ntm --robot-send=<session> --panes=<idx> --type=cc --msg="…"` → each agent runs `macro_start_session` + `reserveOrFail` + close bead with `br update --status closed` and write `.pi-flywheel/completion/<bead>.json` per the [Pre-Completion Quality Gate](#pre-completion-quality-gate-mandatory-for-every-spawned-implementor).
- **Conventions** — see [`Hard Constraints`](#hard-constraints), [`Code Conventions`](#code-conventions), and [`Tool name deprecation`](#tool-name-deprecation).

## High-stakes track (dueling-idea-wizards integration)

The flywheel has a **standard track** (single-agent at every phase) and a **high-stakes track** that surfaces adversarial cross-scoring at four seams. Both tracks share the same checkpoint state, beads, and downstream tools — only the generator changes.

The duel is one extra row in the menus the user already sees when running `/agent-flywheel:start`. No CLI flags to remember.

| Seam              | Standard generator                  | Duel-track replacement                                     | Trigger                                                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 3 Discover   | `flywheel_discover` / `/idea-wizard`| `/dueling-idea-wizards --mode=ideas`                       | "Duel" row in the discovery-depth menu                 |
| Step 5 Plan       | `flywheel_plan(mode=standard\|deep)`| `flywheel_plan(mode=duel)` → `--mode=architecture`         | "Duel plan" row in the plan-mode menu                  |
| Reality-check     | single-agent gap report             | `--duel` → `--mode=reliability --focus=vision-vs-code drift`| "Duel reality-check" row in `/flywheel-reality-check`  |
| Step 9 Review     | 5-agent fresh-eyes                  | 2-agent `--mode=security\|reliability`                     | Auto-routed for risky beads (p0, security path, etc.)  |

Plus a direct entry point: `/agent-flywheel:flywheel-duel` (state-aware — picks `--mode` from the current phase, routes artifacts into the right `docs/` folder, and chains into `flywheel_discover` / `flywheel_plan` / per-bead review automatically).

**Pre-conditions for any duel.** ntm + ≥2 of {cc, cod, gmi} must be healthy. The doctor's `ntm_binary`, `claude_cli`, `codex_cli`, `gemini_cli`, and `swarm_model_ratio` checks together cover this. Cost: ~20–55 min per run.

**Bead provenance.** Every bead created from a duel-sourced idea or duel-generated plan carries a `## Provenance` block (template in `skills/start/_beads.md` Step 5.5) listing source mode, agent cross-scores (0–1000), the strongest surviving critique that survived the reveal phase, and (if Phase 6.75 ran) a steelman one-liner. Downstream implementers and reviewers inherit the adversarial context without extra prompting — this is the highest-leverage piece of the integration.

**Artifacts.** Duel transcripts (`WIZARD_IDEAS_*.md`, `WIZARD_SCORES_*.md`, `WIZARD_REACTIONS_*.md`, `DUELING_WIZARDS_REPORT.md`) live in the project root by default; the flywheel routes the synthesis report into `docs/discovery/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/duels/`, or `docs/reviews/` based on phase. `flywheel-cleanup` flags WIZARD_*.md older than 7 days; never auto-deletes — these are the irreplaceable adversarial-debate record.

## Build

```bash
cd mcp-server && npm run build
```

Compiles TypeScript from `mcp-server/src/` to `mcp-server/dist/`.

**`mcp-server/dist/` is committed** so the plugin works immediately after `/plugin install` with no Node build step on the user's machine. If you change anything in `mcp-server/src/`, run `npm run build` and commit the resulting `dist/` changes in the same PR. The `dist-drift` CI job fails any PR where `dist/` is out of sync with `src/`.

## Hard Constraints

1. **No `console.log` in MCP server code.** The server uses stdin/stdout for JSON-RPC. Any stdout write corrupts the communication channel. Use `createLogger(ctx)` from `./logger.js` for all diagnostics — it writes structured JSON to stderr only.
2. **Never edit `mcp-server/dist/`.** It is compiled output. Edit sources in `mcp-server/src/` and rebuild.
3. **TypeScript strict mode.** `tsconfig.json` enables `strict: true`. All code must pass strict type checking.
4. **NodeNext module resolution.** Use `.js` extensions in all relative imports (e.g., `import { foo } from "./bar.js"`), even when the source file is `.ts`.
5. **ESM only.** `"type": "module"` in `package.json`. No CommonJS `require()`.
6. **Never write directly to `.pi-flywheel/checkpoint.json`.** Use `flywheel_*` MCP tools for state management.
7. **All `exec` calls must include a `timeout`.** No open-ended shell commands.
8. **Propagate `signal` through `exec` calls.** When the calling function receives an `AbortSignal`, pass it to every `exec()` call: `exec(cmd, args, { timeout, cwd, signal })`. The `ExecFn` type (from `exec.ts`) accepts `signal?: AbortSignal`.

## Key File Paths

- `mcp-server/src/` — TypeScript source (edit here)
- `mcp-server/dist/` — compiled output (never edit)
- `.pi-flywheel/` — runtime state directory
- `skills/` — skill `.md` files injected into agent system prompts
- `commands/*.md` — natural language flywheel commands
- `docs/plans/` — plan artifacts from deep-plan sessions

## Available CLI Tools

- **`br`** — bead tracker CLI: create, list, update status, approve beads.
- **`bv`** — bead visualizer: renders bead status dashboards, dependency graphs.
- **`ccc`** — optional codebase indexing/search tool. Not required; the system falls back gracefully if unavailable.
- **`npm run bead-viewer`** — (v3.7.0+) read-only browser-based bead-graph visualizer with cycle highlighting + click-to-detail. Hard-bound to `127.0.0.1`. Serves `br list --json` + `br dep list --json` as a Cytoscape graph. Use when `bv` terminal output is hard to scan (>50 nodes).

## MCP tools quick reference

Current-tool index (HEAD = v3.12.0). One line per tool, alphabetical. Detailed semantics live in the version-sliced sections below; this is the cold-reader affordance.

- **`flywheel_advance_wave`** — close a completed wave, mark beads `closed`, surface `nextWave[]` ready beads. Stage-1 attestation gate: `FW_ATTESTATION_REQUIRED=1` flips warn-only to hard-block on missing/invalid completion evidence.
- **`flywheel_approve_beads({ action })`** — review/approve bead set; actions: `start | polish | reject | advanced | git-diff-review`. Returns quality score + hotspot matrix + 3 or 4-option launch menu.
- **`flywheel_calibrate({ sinceDays? })`** — bead-template effort calibration from closed `br list` rows.
- **`flywheel_convergence({ planSlug })`** — read-only `ConvergenceState` from `.pi-flywheel/plans/<slug>/convergence.json` (multi-signal score + B6 oscillation flag). v3.12.0+. See "MCP tools added in v3.12.0" for B6 semantics.
- **`flywheel_discover`** — surface ranked improvement ideas after a profile pass.
- **`flywheel_doctor`** — health sweep, currently 21 checks (incl. v3.12.0 `convergence_state_validity` and v3.13.0 `outcome_rubric_validity`). Read-only.
- **`flywheel_get_skill({ name })`** — bundled skill body in one round-trip. Preferred over `Read` for skill lookups.
- **`flywheel_memory({ operation, query?, content? })`** — CASS memory; operations: `search | store | draft_postmortem | draft_solution_doc | refresh_learnings`. The `refresh_learnings` op classifies `docs/solutions/` entries Keep/Update/Consolidate/Replace/Delete.
- **`flywheel_observe`** — single-call session-state snapshot; surfaces hints from missing completion attestations.
- **`flywheel_plan({ mode })`** — planner; modes: `standard | deep | duel`. Deep auto-detects `docs/brainstorms/<slug>-*.md`.
- **`flywheel_profile`** — repo profile with git-HEAD-keyed cache. Always call first.
- **`flywheel_remediate({ checkName })`** — apply canonical fix for a failing doctor check (per-check mutex, `dry_run` default).
- **`flywheel_review`** — 5 fresh-eyes reviewers per risky bead, or duel for p0 / security beads.
- **`flywheel_select({ goal })`** — set selected goal and transition to planning phase.
- **`flywheel_verify_beads`** — verify closed beads have valid completion evidence; reads `.pi-flywheel/completion/<id>.json`.
- **`flywheel_synthesize_rubric({ action })`** — v3.13.0; synthesize / validate / edit / regenerate the cycle-level outcome rubric at `.pi-flywheel/plans/<slug>/rubric.md`. Called from `_planning.md` Step 5.6.5 after the operator picks Create beads.
- **`flywheel_grade_outcome`** — v3.13.0; decorrelated outcome grader. **Cursor port:** `grader_deferred` → Task (`grader.model` in config) → re-call with `graderStdout`; includes `data.askQuestion` for verdict gates. Legacy: codex/claude CLI when `FW_GRADER_BACKEND=codex|claude`. Persists `.pi-flywheel/plans/<slug>/grading/iteration-<N>.json`. Step 9.5.0 in `_wrapup.md`.
- **`flywheel_approve_beads({ action: 'remediate' })`** — v3.13.0 action; create exactly one bead from a failing-criterion verdict using the §"Remediation Bead Template" body. Called once per failing criterion when the operator picks Iterate at the wrap-up verdict gate.

> **Convention.** When a future MCP tool ships, update both this quick-reference AND the version-sliced section below ("MCP tools added in v<X.Y.Z>"). The quick-ref is an at-a-glance index; the version-sliced sections preserve change history.

## MCP tools added in v3.7.0

- **`flywheel_remediate({ checkName, autoConfirm?, mode? })`** — applies the canonical fix for a failing doctor check. Default mode is `dry_run`; pass `mode: 'execute'` + `autoConfirm: true` to actually mutate. Per-check mutex prevents concurrent calls. Six handlers ship: `agent_mail_liveness`, `checkpoint_validity`, `cli_binary`, `dist_drift`, `mcp_connectivity`, `orphaned_worktrees`. Other doctor checks return `remediation_unavailable` (manual hint surfaced by SKILL.md). Result envelope includes `verifiedGreen: boolean` (re-runs the original probe after apply).
- **`flywheel_calibrate({ cwd, sinceDays? })`** — aggregates `br list --json --status closed` rows by template, computes mean/median/p95 actual vs `EFFORT_TO_MINUTES[template.estimatedEffort]`. Prefers `git log --grep=<bead-id>` first-commit ts as `started_ts` proxy (capped 200/run). Drops clock-skew samples. Writes report to `.pi-flywheel/calibration.json`. **Note (v3.7.0):** `br create` doesn't yet tag beads with their template id, so the report is currently `__untemplated__`-only. See `claude-orchestrator-1v5` for the fix.
- **`flywheel_get_skill({ name: "<plugin>:<skill>" })`** — serves a bundled skill markdown body in one MCP call. Bundle at `mcp-server/dist/skills.bundle.json` (built by `npm run build`). 4-layer drift defense: build-time `check:skills-bundle` CI gate, runtime `manifestSha256` integrity check (falls back to disk on mismatch), per-entry `srcSha256` stale-warn, `FW_SKILL_BUNDLE=off` env-bypass for contributors editing skills live. Returns `{ name, frontmatter, body, source: 'bundle' | 'disk', staleWarn? }`.

### Fast path for skill bodies (PRIMARY)

When loading any flywheel skill — entry-point (`/start`) or sub-phase (`_planning.md`, `_implement.md`, etc.) — **prefer `flywheel_get_skill` over `Read`**. Single MCP round-trip, served from the bundled body, ~10× less context noise than `Read` (no directory listing, no path resolution).

**Skill-stub recovery.** If invoking the `Skill` tool returns only the frontmatter / pointer text instead of the canonical body (the harness sometimes ack's "skill already loaded — follow it directly" instead of inlining for re-invocations), **do NOT fall back to `Read`**. Call `flywheel_get_skill({ name: "agent-flywheel:<skill>" })` instead. Examples:

- `/start` → `flywheel_observe` then `start_ceremony`; `start_discover` only after Step 0 routes to scan/discover
- Phase boundary → `flywheel_get_skill({ name: "agent-flywheel:start_planning" })` (one phase at a time)
- Same for `start_beads`, `start_implement`, `start_review`, `start_wrapup`, `start_reality_check`, `start_deslop`, `start_saturation`, `start_inflight_prompt`.

`Read` is the disk-fallback path — only use it if the MCP call errors (bundle disabled via `FW_SKILL_BUNDLE=off`, transport down, or skill not in bundle).

## MCP tools added in v3.11.0

The 2026-04-30 3-way duel cohort (`docs/duels/2026-04-30.md`, plan `docs/plans/2026-04-30-duel-winners.md`) shipped a runtime-safety + recovery substrate built around three composable features.

- **`flywheel_observe({ cwd })`** — single-call session-state snapshot. Versioned `FlywheelObserveReport` covering `cwd`, `git.{branch, head, dirty, untracked[]}`, `checkpoint.{exists, phase?, selectedGoal?, planDocument?, activeBeadIds[]?, warnings[]}`, `beads.{initialized, counts, ready[]}`, `agentMail.{reachable, unreadCount?, warning?}`, `ntm.{available, panes[]?, warning?}`, `artifacts.{wizard[], flywheelScratch[]}`, and `hints[]` with `severity: info|warn|red`. Idempotent and non-mutating; doctor probes are cached or short-budgeted (<1.5s total tool runtime); every external probe degrades gracefully (sub-section flagged `unavailable: true` rather than failing the whole call). Hint surface includes missing or invalid completion attestations from the Stage 1 ledger so a forgotten dogfood file is visible at the next `/start` rather than silently rotting.
- **Completion Evidence Attestation (Stage 1).** New module `mcp-server/src/completion-report.ts` exports `CompletionReportSchemaV1` (Zod, `version: 1` additive forever), `readCompletionReport(cwd, beadId)`, `validateCompletionReport(report, bead, { cwd? })`, `formatCompletionEvidenceSummary(report)`, and `writeCompletionReport(cwd, report)`. `flywheel_verify_beads` reads `.pi-flywheel/completion/<beadId>.json` for every closed bead and surfaces `missingEvidence[]` / `invalidEvidence[]`. `flywheel_advance_wave` is the gate — Stage 1 default is warn-only (`needsEvidence: true` on the outcome); set `FW_ATTESTATION_REQUIRED=1` to flip to hard-block returning `attestation_missing` / `attestation_invalid` (2 new structured error codes). Implementor prompts in `skills/flywheel-swarm/SKILL.md`, `skills/start/_implement.md`, and `commands/flywheel-swarm.md` carry a worked JSON example.
- **Lock-aware reservation helper + `RESERVE001` lint rule.** New module `mcp-server/src/agent-mail-helpers.ts` exports `reserveOrFail(paths, opts)` and `releaseReservations(reservationIds)`. `reserveOrFail` wraps `agentMailRPC("file_reservation_paths", ...)` and treats any non-empty `conflicts` array as failure even when `granted` is also populated, with one exponential-backoff retry. New lint rule `mcp-server/src/lint/rules/reserve001.ts` flags raw `agentMailRPC("file_reservation_paths")` call sites outside the helper module; the existing single use inside `reserveFileReservations()` (`mcp-server/src/agent-mail.ts`) is baselined; new offenders fail CI.

## MCP tools added in v3.12.0

The 2026-05-06 APR-Pro adoption (`05071af`, `docs/research/research-apr-pro-landed-2026-05-06.md`) shipped multi-signal plan convergence and the B6 oscillation guard inspired by APR-Pro's automated plan reviser pipeline.

- **`flywheel_convergence({ cwd, planSlug })`** — read-only handler that returns the persisted `ConvergenceState` for a plan slug. State path: `.pi-flywheel/plans/<slug>/convergence.json` (per Phase 12 §12.3 — no `.flywheel/` rename). Source: `mcp-server/src/tools/convergence-tool.ts`, registered in `server.ts`. Score is multi-signal (delta-text, file-coverage, dependency-graph stability) per `convergence.ts` `SCORE_VERSION`. Result envelope includes `oscillation.detected: boolean` plus `signFlips`, `revisions`. Plan slug derived via `planSlugFromIdentifier(planPathOrId)`.
- **B6 oscillation guard semantics.** When `signFlips > revisions / 3`, the convergence state flips to `status: "oscillating"`, surfaced via `flywheel_convergence` and the `convergence_state_validity` doctor check. Step 5.45 (picked-up-plan menu) renders the score in the question text only — never arms a default option (per Phase 12 §12.5 + README §Design Philosophy #3, every decision routes through `AskUserQuestion`). Auto-approve at score ≥ 0.90 still routes through the user gate; the kill-switch on `flywheel_advance_wave` consults convergence + oscillation flags but cannot bypass the user.
- **`convergence_state_validity` doctor check.** Probes that the persisted `convergence.json` parses against `ConvergenceStateSchema` and the `signFlips/revisions` invariants are intact. `flywheel_doctor` surfaces it under the standard 11-check sweep (now 12 entries with this addition); severity defaults to yellow on parse failure, red only on schema-required-field violations.
- **NTM pane priority — changed.** v3.12.0 made `--cod=` the default secondary lane after `--cc=`. **Superseded in v3.17.0** by mixed `cc:cod:gem` 1:1:1 as the canonical default; see the "NTM pane priority" section below for the current rule and the substitution ladder.

## MCP tools added in v3.13.0

The 2026-05-08 outcome-grading cycle (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-outcome-grading-design.md`, plan `docs/plans/2026-05-08-outcome-grading-synthesized.md`) ports the Anthropic Managed Agents API's "rubric + decorrelated grader + iteration loop" pattern locally — concepts only; no MA API substrate adopted.

- **`flywheel_synthesize_rubric({ cwd, action?, planSlug?, planPath?, editIntent?, force? })`** — author / validate / edit / regenerate the cycle-level outcome rubric. Writes `.pi-flywheel/plans/<slug>/rubric.md` and a sidecar `.rubric.lock` (planContentSha cache). `action` ∈ `synthesize | validate | edit | regenerate`. Edits are deterministic for `tighten | add | remove`; LLM-mediated for `custom`. Operator-edited rubrics (`source: 'edited' || 'user'`) are never overwritten without `force=true` (R6 mitigation). Discriminated success kinds: `rubric_synthesized | rubric_preserved | rubric_edited | rubric_validated`.
- **`flywheel_grade_outcome({ cwd, planSlug?, force?, graderStdout? })`** — decorrelated outcome grader. **Cursor port (default):** `grader_deferred` → one Task (`flywheel.config.yaml` → `grader.model`) → re-call with `graderStdout`; `modelUsed: 'cursor'`. Includes `data.askQuestion` for verdict gates. **Legacy:** codex/claude CLI when `FW_GRADER_BACKEND=codex|claude`. 4-tier `cycleStartSha` ladder; iteration-cap coercion server-side; ENOSPC graceful degrade. Success kinds: `grader_deferred | grader_verdict | grading_skipped | grading_capped | grading_persistence_failed`.
- **`flywheel_approve_beads({ action: 'remediate', remediation })`** — new action that creates exactly one bead from a failing-criterion verdict using the verbatim §"Remediation Bead Template" body. Increments `state.iterationRound`. T11 (`_wrapup.md` Step 9.5.0 Iterate branch) calls this once per criterion where `verdict.perCriterion[i].status !== 'met'`.
- **`outcome_rubric_validity` doctor check.** Read-only probe of the active plan's `rubric.md`. Severity: green when no rubric / valid rubric (≥3 criteria), yellow when file missing / parse failure, red when criteria array is empty. Hints are verbatim §"Doctor Hints"; remediation routes through the operator-driven Step 5.6.5 rubric gate (auto-rewrite would silently overwrite operator edits).
- **8 new structured error codes** in `mcp-server/src/errors.ts`: `rubric_synth_invalid`, `rubric_missing`, `grader_timeout`, `verdict_invalid`, `grader_unavailable`, `cycle_start_sha_unset`, `outcome_iteration_capped`, `concurrent_grade`. Only `grader_timeout` is `retryable: true` by default.
- **Additive `FlywheelState` fields**: `outcomeRubricPath?`, `outcomeGradingSkipped?`, `outcomeGradingHistory?` (FIFO-capped at last 5), `maxOutcomeIterations?` (bounded `[1,5]` via `getMaxOutcomeIterations`), `cycleStartSha?`, `cycleEndTestOutput?`. v3.11.x and v3.12.x checkpoints continue to load with all six undefined — see `mcp-server/src/__tests__/migration.test.ts` and the frozen v3.12 fixture.

### Distinguishing `flywheel_review` from outcome grading

| Concern | `flywheel_review` | Outcome grading (v3.13.0) |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Per-bead implementation | Whole-cycle plan-vs-result |
| When | After every bead's commit | Once at wrap-up (Step 9.5.0) |
| Decorrelation | Same model family (CC reviewers) | Cursor Task grader (default) or codex/claude CLI (legacy) |
| Output | Reviewer findings + revisions | `GraderVerdictSchemaV1` JSON envelope |
| Iteration loop | Hit-me retries | Iterate ↔ remediate beads, capped at `state.maxOutcomeIterations` |

Both run in the same cycle and complement each other. `flywheel_review` ensures each bead lands cleanly; outcome grading ensures the cycle as a whole achieves what the operator approved at plan-time.

### Env knobs (v3.13.0)

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `FW_GRADER_BACKEND` | `cursor` (Cursor plugin) | `cursor` = defer to Task + `graderStdout`. `codex` or `claude` = legacy CLI subprocess from MCP. |
| `FW_GRADER_MODEL` | `opus-4.6` (via `grader.model` in config) | Cursor: Task model slug. Legacy codex: `--model` for `codex exec`. |
| `FW_GRADER_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Legacy CLI grader budget only. Surfaced as `grader_timeout` (retryable) on overflow. |
| `FW_GRADER_FORCE_CLAUDE` | unset | Legacy only: when `=1`, skips codex and uses `claude --print`. |
| `FW_RUBRIC_SYNTH_TIMEOUT_MS` | `60000` | Per-call rubric synthesizer budget. Hard-fails as `rubric_synth_invalid` on overflow. |
| `FW_MAX_OUTCOME_ITERATIONS` | `3` (clamped to `[1,5]`) | Default for `state.maxOutcomeIterations`. Per-cycle override happens via state edits, not a flag. |
| `FW_COMMIT_BATCH_THRESHOLD` | `8` | Commits accumulated since `state.lastBatchReviewSha` before `flywheel_advance_wave` returns `nextStep: batch_review_due` instead of `nextWave`. `0` or unset disables the auto-trigger; existing post-wave gate flow is unchanged. Overridable per session via the `_implement.md` Pre-flight `AskUserQuestion`. |

### Outcome grader model resolution (Cursor port)

1. **`flywheel.config.yaml` → `grader.model`** (plugin default `opus-4.6`)
2. **`FW_GRADER_MODEL`** (env override)
3. Spawn **one** decorrelated **Task**; submit stdout via `graderStdout`

Legacy CLI cascade (`FW_GRADER_BACKEND=codex`): `FW_GRADER_MODEL` → `gpt-5.5` → `claude --print` fallback.

State fields added by the fresh-eyes auto-trigger feature (v3.17.0+):

- `state.commitBatchCounter?: number` — commits accumulated since `lastBatchReviewSha`; incremented as impl agents commit; reset to 0 on review dispatch.
- `state.commitBatchThreshold?: number` — per-session threshold (defaults to `FW_COMMIT_BATCH_THRESHOLD`). `0` or unset disables auto-trigger.
- `state.lastBatchReviewSha?: string` — baseline SHA for the next batch-review diff. Updated at dispatch time (NOT after verdict) so in-flight commits during review don't double-trigger.
- `state.batchReviewSynthesizedBeads?: Record<string, string[]>` — per-sha-range record (`<from-sha>..<to-sha>` → ordered bead IDs) of beads auto-synthesized from `blocking` verdicts. Downstream tooling (rollback path, audit reports) reads this to map approve/reject decisions back to specific findings.

### Decided policy (v3.13.0)

- **`cycleStartSha` capture point.** `flywheel_select` writes `state.cycleStartSha` at goal-set time (OQ-A resolution). On detached HEAD / no-commits / git-missing, the field stays undefined and the grader's 4-tier ladder fires.
- **Skip-rubric stickiness.** One cycle per skip (OQ-B resolution). The next `flywheel_select` clears `state.outcomeGradingSkipped` so the operator gets a fresh prompt at every Step 5.6.5. CASS records consecutive skips as a learning so a recurring skip pattern surfaces in `flywheel_doctor` over time.

## NTM is mandatory for all spawned work

**Hard rule.** Every multi-agent spawn — planning fan-out, swarm waves, deslop sweeps, reality-check follow-ups, scrutiny passes, parallel reviewers, ad-hoc "do these N things in parallel" requests — **must go through NTM** (`ntm spawn` + `ntm --robot-send`). No exceptions.

**What is forbidden as a substitute for NTM:**
- Raw `Task`/`Agent` tool calls to fan out implementation work onto multiple Claude subagents.
- Backgrounded `claude --print` / `codex` / `pi` / `gemini` shells launched with `&` or `run_in_background`.
- `tmux new-window` / `tmux split-window` invoked directly (NTM owns pane lifecycle, robot-send addressing, stagger, and stuck-pane recovery).
- Spawning agents through any other orchestrator (custom shell loops, Makefile parallel targets, `xargs -P`, GNU `parallel`) for work that produces code or PRs.

**Why:** NTM provides the canonical pane registry, robot-send addressing (`--type=cc|pi|cod|gem`), Agent Mail integration, stuck-pane detection, stagger to avoid cold-boot thundering herd, and the `--no-user` discipline. Bypassing it loses observability, breaks file-reservation handshakes, and produces work the flywheel cannot track or recover.

**Allowed exceptions (narrow):**
- Single-shot research / read-only Q&A subagents that produce no code and no PRs (e.g. `Explore`, `general-purpose` for one-off lookups). These can use the `Task`/`Agent` tool directly.
- Single foreground `Bash` invocations that complete in-band (linter, test, build).
- Codex-rescue / triangulation calls where the codex skill's contract explicitly handles the dispatch.

If you find yourself wanting to spawn N>1 coding workers without NTM, stop and load `/ntm` + `/vibing-with-ntm` first. Reviewers: reject PRs whose skill changes introduce non-NTM fan-out for implementation work.

## NTM pane priority

**Canonical rule (Changed in v3.17.0).** Mixed `cc:cod:gem` 1:1:1 — Claude, Codex, and Gemini at equal share — is the default for every NTM spawn. The model-diversified split is the point: three independent reasoners running in parallel surface different failure modes, and the 1:1:1 ratio is what downstream pipelines (Step 9 fresh-eyes, duel review, batch synthesis) implicitly assume when they reconcile cross-agent votes.

**Baseline pattern.** A six-pane spawn:

```
ntm spawn <project> --label <purpose> --no-user \
  --cc=2 --cod=2 --gmi=2 --stagger-mode=smart
```

Smaller swarms scale the ratio down (e.g. `--cc=1 --cod=1 --gmi=1` for three panes); larger swarms scale it up while keeping each provider's share equal until the substitution ladder fires.

**Substitution ladder when a provider is unavailable.** The doctor's `claude_cli`, `codex_cli`, `gemini_cli`, `swarm_model_ratio`, `codex_config_compat`, and (v3.17.0) `gemini_model_compat` checks together signal which lanes the host can actually fill. When a provider is missing or non-green, its share is reassigned in this order:

1. **Missing `gmi` → `cod`** (closest peer in the diversity space — both are non-Claude reasoners with comparable depth).
2. **`cod` also unavailable → `pi`** (Pi inherits the lane only when both Gemini and Codex are off the table; this is also the path the noob-onboarding flow takes when the host has no API credentials).
3. **All three peers unavailable → `cc`** (cc-only is the last-resort floor; it works, but it gives up the cross-agent fresh-eyes signal — operators should treat it as a degraded mode and log it).

The same ladder runs lane-by-lane: a four-pane spawn that loses Gemini becomes `--cc=2 --cod=2`, not `--cc=4`. The operator preference for "pure cc" swarms is the explicit override that lands at step 3 — it is not the default.

**Retired rules.**

- The v3.12.0 "prefer `--cod=` over `--pi=`" priority is **retired**. Cod-first only applies inside the substitution ladder above (step 1 fallback for missing Gemini); it is not the canonical secondary lane in fresh spawns.
- The pre-v3.12.0 "pi over cod" priority is also **retired**. Pi is the second fallback (step 2), not a default.

Applies to every `ntm spawn` and `ntm --robot-send` invocation in this plugin's skills (`skills/start/_planning.md`, `skills/start/_implement.md`, `skills/start/_deslop.md`, `skills/start/_reality_check.md`, `skills/start/_inflight_prompt.md`, `skills/start/SKILL.md`, and any future swarm/orchestrator skill). Reviewers: reject any PR that ships `--cc=N` alone, `--cod=N` alone, or `--pi=N` alone in production swarm code without a substitution-ladder justification tied to a non-green doctor row.

## Bead Lifecycle

After running an implementation, ALWAYS close the bead and verify the close took effect:

```
br update <bead-id> --status closed
br show <bead-id> --json   # confirm "status": "closed"
```

If the second call shows anything else, retry the update once before reporting completion. The agent-flywheel coordinator additionally calls `flywheel_verify_beads` after each wave to auto-close stragglers that have a matching commit (`git log --grep=<bead-id> -1`), so a missed close is recoverable but not free — verify locally first.

`flywheel_review` reconciles the bead state automatically: `looks-good` is idempotent on already-closed beads, `hit-me` runs a post-close audit, and `skip` returns `already_closed`. Do not skip `flywheel_review` for closed beads — the legacy "spawn reviewers from `git diff <sha>~1 <sha>`" workaround is no longer required.

## Step 9 - Wave-completion gate

Step 9 is a two-stage gate:

1. **`flywheel_verify_beads`** - status reconciliation: closed beads exist in `br`, matching commits are found for stragglers, and completion attestation files are present.
2. **`flywheel_compliance_audit`** (new in v3.14.0) - invokes `/beads-compliance-and-completion-verification` in single-bead-parallel mode to score every closed bead 0-1000 against literal acceptance criteria. Beads scoring below 700 are auto-reopened. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-beads-compliance-integration-design.md`.

Skip via `FW_COMPLIANCE_OVERRIDE=<bead-id-list>` or the in-menu override path.

## Pre-Completion Quality Gate (MANDATORY for every spawned implementor)

Before any swarm/NTM agent reports a bead complete (or sends its completion message), it MUST execute, in order:

1. **UBS scan on changed files.** Invoke the `/ubs-workflow` skill in changed-files mode (not full-repo). Every finding must be fixed, filed as a new bead with rationale, or explicitly justified in the completion message. Silently dropping UBS findings is a review-bounce condition.
2. **Repo verify commands.** Run the build/test/typecheck/lint commands relevant to the surfaces touched, per this file's specific rules. If a remote-execution helper (e.g. `rch`) is the canonical path, use it — do not skip with "looks fine locally".
3. **Self-review with fresh eyes.** Re-read your own diff for regressions, unsafe assumptions, missing tests, and edge cases. Fix before sending the completion message.

The completion message itself must include: (a) UBS result summary (`clean` / `fixed N` / `deferred to bead ids …`), (b) verify command outcome (or the helper handle), (c) one-line self-review summary. Coordinator and `flywheel_review` reject completions missing this evidence.

This rule is binding on every NTM-spawned implementor (swarm waves, deslop sweeps, reality-check follow-ups, parallel "do these N things" requests) and is the canonical contract for `skills/flywheel-swarm/SKILL.md`'s marching-orders payload. Do not weaken it inline; if a specific bead truly cannot run UBS or verify (e.g. docs-only diff), say so explicitly in the completion message instead of skipping silently.

### Completion Evidence Attestation (v3.11.0+)

Prose evidence in the completion message is necessary but no longer sufficient. Every implementor MUST also write a versioned `CompletionReport` JSON file to `.pi-flywheel/completion/<beadId>.json` matching `CompletionReportSchemaV1` in `mcp-server/src/completion-report.ts`. This is the durable ledger entry the coordinator reads and gates on:

- `flywheel_verify_beads` reads each closed bead's report and surfaces `missingEvidence[]` / `invalidEvidence[]` in its structured response.
- `flywheel_advance_wave` is the gate. **Stage 1 (default) is warn-only** — it sets `needsEvidence: true` on the outcome, surfaces the count in human text, and still advances. Set `FW_ATTESTATION_REQUIRED=1` in the coordinator's environment to flip to hard-block, returning the structured error code `attestation_missing` or `attestation_invalid` with `error.hint` populated. The default flips to required in a future release once the corpus stabilises.

The schema is `version: 1` and **additive forever** — never remove keys; new fields must be optional. Required shape: `version`, `beadId`, `agentName`, `status` (`closed|blocked|partial`), `changedFiles[]`, `commits[]`, `ubs.{ran, summary, findingsFixed, deferredBeadIds[], skippedReason?}`, `verify[].{command, exitCode, summary}`, `selfReview.{ran, summary}`, `beadClosedVerified`, `createdAt` (ISO-8601). Optional: `paneName`, `reservationsReleased`, `ubs.skippedReason`. Status `closed` requires `beadClosedVerified=true`. `changedFiles` rejects absolute paths and `..`-traversal at the schema layer; `validateCompletionReport(report, bead, { cwd })` adds a path-resolve check as defense-in-depth.

Docs-only diffs: set `ubs.ran=false` with a non-empty `ubs.skippedReason` ("docs-only diff", etc.). Do not silently skip. Implementor prompts in `skills/flywheel-swarm/SKILL.md`, `skills/start/_implement.md`, and `commands/flywheel-swarm.md` carry a worked JSON example — copy that shape rather than improvising.

`flywheel_observe.hints[]` surfaces missing/stale attestation files during session recovery (severity `warn` for missing, `red` for invalid), so a forgotten attestation shows up at the next `/start` rather than silently rotting.

## Agent Coordination

- Bootstrap your agent-mail session with `macro_start_session` at the start of each task.
- Before modifying any file, request a file reservation via agent-mail.
- Report errors to the team lead via agent-mail with subject `[error] <context>`. Do not silently skip tasks.
- Check your agent-mail inbox at task start for updates or cancellations.

### Known issue: agent-mail exclusive-reservation enforcement is advisory

`file_reservation_paths(... exclusive=true)` does **not** reject overlapping requests at the server level. When two agents request exclusive reservations on the same path, the second request returns a response with **both** a populated `granted` array (a fresh reservation id with `exclusive: true`) **and** a populated `conflicts` array naming the existing holder. The server tells you about the conflict but issues the reservation anyway. Reproduced 2026-04-27 against agent-mail running at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` (bead `agent-flywheel-plugin-j0b`).

**Coordinator-side mitigation, mandatory for now:**

1. **Use `reserveOrFail()` from `mcp-server/src/agent-mail-helpers.ts`** (v3.11.0+). This helper wraps `agentMailRPC("file_reservation_paths", ...)` and treats any non-empty `conflicts` array as failure even when `granted` is also populated, with one exponential-backoff retry before failing. **Do not call `agentMailRPC("file_reservation_paths", ...)` directly** — the `RESERVE001` lint rule (`mcp-server/src/lint/rules/reserve001.ts`) flags raw call sites and the existing single use inside `reserveFileReservations()` (`mcp-server/src/agent-mail.ts`) is baselined; new offenders fail CI. Use `releaseReservations(reservationIds)` for the symmetric release.
2. The pre-commit guard (`/Users/kevtrinh/.mcp_agent_mail_git_mailbox_repo/projects/<slug>/.git/hooks/pre-commit`, installed via `install_precommit_guard`) is the second line of defense — it blocks commits that touch a path reserved by another agent. Do not bypass it.
3. Round-1 of the 2026-04-26 reality-check session showed two agents (RoseFalcon + StormyAnchor) holding exclusive reservations on `mcp-server/scripts/lint-skill.ts` simultaneously. No actual write-conflict materialised that session, but the latent risk is real — the `reserveOrFail()` mitigation above is what closes it from the coordinator side.

This is a server-side bug in mcp-agent-mail; the upstream fix should make the second exclusive request return `granted: []` with the existing holder in `conflicts`. Until that lands, the helper-routed discipline above is load-bearing.

## Agent-Mail Transport

### Transport History

The agent-mail MCP connection type has changed several times:

| Commit | Change | Outcome |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `c12c6be` | Changed type from `url` to `sse` | SSE broke the connection |
| `0a7a8c2` | Reverted to `url` | Restored connectivity |
| `7c08923` | Changed type from `url` to `http` | Current stable transport |

**Current recommended `.mcp.json` configuration:**

```json
{
  "agent-mail": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp"
  }
}
```

Do **not** use `"type": "sse"` or `"type": "url"` — use `"http"`.

### Diagnosing Connection Issues

1. Ensure the agent-mail server is running. The flywheel targets the **Rust port** ([`mcp_agent_mail_rust`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail_rust)) as the primary distribution; start it with `am serve-http` (or `mcp-agent-mail serve` if `am` is not on PATH). Legacy Python fallback: `uv run python -m mcp_agent_mail.cli serve-http` (works because both speak the same HTTP MCP protocol on port 8765).
2. Verify port 8765 is listening: `lsof -i :8765`
3. Test the endpoint: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` (also: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/health/liveness` should return `{"status":"alive"}`).

### Mutating `am doctor` maintenance and mailbox activity locks

The Rust `am serve-http` runtime intentionally holds `.mailbox.activity.lock` and `storage.sqlite3.activity.lock` for the lifetime of the server. If you run mutating `am doctor` operations while the service is active, you may see:

```
Resource is temporarily busy ... mailbox activity lock is busy ... another Agent Mail runtime or mutating `am doctor` operation is already active
```

Do **not** delete the lock files. Stop the owning service/runtime first, run maintenance, then restart it. The canonical flywheel path is:

```
flywheel_remediate({ checkName: "agent_mail_liveness", mode: "execute", autoConfirm: true })
```

That remediation stops launchd/systemd/best-effort runtimes, runs `am doctor repair --yes` and `am doctor archive-normalize --yes`, restarts Agent Mail, and verifies `/health/liveness`. NTM swarm agents must not run mutating `am doctor` commands directly; they should report Agent Mail health issues to the coordinator.

### Programmatic Health Check

`checkAgentMailHealth()` (exported from `mcp-server/src/agent-mail.ts`) sends a lightweight HEAD request to `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp` with a 3-second timeout. It returns:

- `{ reachable: true, transport: "http" }` on success.
- `{ reachable: false, error: "..." }` with an actionable message on failure.

The result is cached for the session on success. On failure, the cache expires after **30 seconds** and triggers a re-check (so a briefly-unreachable server is retried automatically). This function does not block operations that do not need agent-mail; callers decide how to handle an unreachable result.

## Code Conventions

- Named exports only (no default exports).
- Types live in `mcp-server/src/types.ts`. Import with `import type { ... }`.
- `ExecFn` type (`mcp-server/src/exec.ts`) wraps all shell command execution. It accepts `{ timeout, cwd, signal? }` — always pass `signal` when available. Import `ExecFn` only from `exec.ts`; do not redefine it locally.
- Errors: by default, throw `new Error(message)` and return structured envelopes at tool boundaries via `makeFlywheelErrorResult` from `mcp-server/src/errors.ts`. The one permitted custom error class is **`FlywheelError`** (also in `errors.ts`) — it is framework-internal, threads tagged error codes through nested helpers back to the tool boundary, and MUST NOT be subclassed. Do not introduce ad-hoc error classes in feature code.
- Use `FlywheelError` when a tagged error must propagate through 4+ call frames before reaching the tool-return boundary (e.g., deep in `deep-plan.ts` synthesis). For top-level tool handlers in `mcp-server/src/tools/*.ts`, use `return makeFlywheelErrorResult(...)` — it builds the structured envelope the SKILL.md orchestrator branches on via `data.error.code`.
- Use `Promise.allSettled` for parallel operations where partial results are acceptable.
- Async functions preferred over callbacks.

## Logging

Use `createLogger(ctx)` from `mcp-server/src/logger.ts` for all diagnostic output. Never use `console.log`, `console.warn`, or `console.error` directly.

```typescript
import { createLogger } from "./logger.js";
const log = createLogger("my-module");

log.info("doing thing");
log.warn("something odd", { detail: value });
log.error("failed", { err: String(err) });
```

Log level is controlled by the `ORCH_LOG_LEVEL` env var (default: `"warn"`). Levels: `debug < info < warn < error`.

## Testing

The MCP server uses **Vitest** (`mcp-server/vitest.config.ts`, `include: src/**/*.test.ts`). CI runs `npm test` in `plugins/cursor-orchestrator/mcp-server` (`.github/workflows/orchestrator-mcp.yml`).

From repo root:

```bash
cd plugins/cursor-orchestrator/mcp-server && npm test
```

From this plugin directory:

```bash
cd mcp-server && npm test
```

After MCP `src/` changes, run **`npm test && npm run build`** and commit any resulting `dist/` updates in the same PR.

- `npm test` — single run (`vitest run --passWithNoTests`)
- `npm run test:watch` — watch mode during development

Tests live under `mcp-server/src/__tests__/` (and other `src/**/*.test.ts` paths). Follow existing patterns — use `vi.mock` for external deps, `vi.spyOn(process.stderr, 'write')` to capture logger output, `vi.useFakeTimers()` for time-dependent tests. Always add a regression test when fixing a bug.

## Tool name deprecation

The MCP tools were renamed from `orch_*` to `flywheel_*`. The `orch_*` names are preserved as deprecated aliases that dispatch to the same runners, and will be removed in v4.0. Always use the `flywheel_*` names in new code and docs. v3.11.7+ logs a one-shot `orch_deprecation_warned` per alias call with the canonical replacement, so callers can migrate without searching the diff for the rename.

## SKILL.md linting

Changes to `skills/start/SKILL.md` (and any future SKILL.md files) must pass `npm run lint:skill` from `mcp-server/`. The linter validates AskUserQuestion call sites, slash-skill references, placeholder definitions, and Universal Rule 1 enforcement.

- Local: `cd mcp-server && npm run lint:skill`
- Auto-fix safe issues (future): `npm run lint:skill -- --fix` (deferred to v1.1)
- Update baseline after curating findings: `npm run lint:skill:update-baseline`
- Update skill manifest after adding/removing skills: `npm run lint:skill:update-manifest`

CI enforces this on every PR via `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`lint-skill` job). The job runs `node dist/scripts/lint-skill.js --ci --baseline` and emits PR annotations via the `gha` reporter format.

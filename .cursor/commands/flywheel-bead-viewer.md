description: Open the bead-graph visualizer in your browser.

**First action:** Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for `--json`. Spawn the bead-viewer HTTP server either way (see Invocation below). If `--json`, print `{"viewer_url":"http://127.0.0.1:<port>","port":<port>,"pid":<pid>}` to stdout and exit immediately (do not block, do not auto-open the browser — pass `--no-open`). Otherwise render the standard human-friendly launch message and let the server run in the foreground.

Launch the read-only bead-graph viewer.

## --json output schema

When invoked with `--json`, this command spawns the local HTTP viewer in the
background (no browser auto-launch) and emits one JSON line to stdout describing
the running instance, then exits.

Shape: `{"viewer_url":"http://127.0.0.1:<port>","port":<int>,"pid":<int>}`
On failure: `{"status":"error","error":{"code","message","hint","try_this","retryable"}}`
The HTTP server itself is not an MCP tool — there is no `flywheel_capabilities` contract for the spawned process. The viewer is hard-bound to `127.0.0.1`.


The viewer renders `br list --json` + `br dep list --json` as a Cytoscape graph
with cycle highlighting and click-to-detail. Read-only — no PATCH/POST routes.

## Invocation

```bash
cd <project-root>
node mcp-server/dist/scripts/bead-viewer.js --port 0   # ephemeral port (default)
node mcp-server/dist/scripts/bead-viewer.js --port 7331  # fixed port
node mcp-server/dist/scripts/bead-viewer.js --no-open    # don't auto-launch browser
```

Or via npm script:

```bash
cd mcp-server && npm run bead-viewer
```

## Security
- Hard-bound to `127.0.0.1`. `FW_VIEWER_BIND` overrides are refused unless they match a loopback alias (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`).
- Per-IP rate limit (30 req/s) + connection cap (16 concurrent) + 60s per-conn timeout.
- Bead bodies served as JSON only, never inlined into HTML — XSS-safe.
- Exits within 2s of parent process death (parent-pid watch).
